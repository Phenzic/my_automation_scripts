# Ways To Integrate

You have multiple options when it comes to integrating with Loqate, and
in this article we\'ll look at what those options are, along with their
pros and cons.

The two main integration options are:

- **Using Tags:** this option is available for Address Capture, Email
  Verification and Phone Verification
- **Using APIs:** this option is available for all Loqate products and
  services

There\'s also a third option available for certain situations, which is
**Integrations by Platform**. You can use Address Capture, Verify, Email
Verification and Phone Verification via pre-built integrations with
various tools, including Shopware and Microsoft Dynamics 365. This
offers a slightly different approach to integrating with Loqate
natively, useful if you already use one of the tools that we integrate
with.

The main focus of this article is on Tag and API integrations, although
we\'ve included some information about third-party integrations too, and
a link out to the specific documentation.
:::
::::
:::::

::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
These options are not mutually exclusive, so you can use more than one
in conjunction if you want.

Regardless of which option(s) you choose, you can make changes in the
Account Section for security, customisation and certain features.

#### Use cases

You know your business best, and what your requirements are. Here are a
few examples though of possible use cases, and which of the Tag or API
integration option might be best for each:

  Business Type              Specifics                                   Recommended option
  -------------------------- ------------------------------------------- --------------------
  Financial business         Strictly regulated                          APIs
  Large ecommerce business   Requires considerable customisation         APIs
  Very small business        Uses simple web forms                       Tag
  Small business             Uses cloud-based tools for creating forms   Tag or APIs

 
:::

::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
#### Tag Integrations

The simplest way of setting up Address Verification, Email Verification
and Phone Verification is by using the Tag method, which uses
automatically-generated code snippets that you can insert into your
website to set these services up.

This method is designed for simple webforms, allowing you to set up
standard configurations via your Loqate account.

**Pros**:

- **Speed:** you can get started quickly and easily
- **Simplicity:** there\'s no need for technical know-how, as the
  functionality comes from our JavaScript solution and CSS

**Cons**:

- **Customisation:** unlike API integrations, you don\'t have as much
  control over how your integration works as it will always be based off
  our JavaScript and CSS
- **Security:** adding JavaScript to your website, while an effective
  way of adding new functionality, does come with some security
  considerations, and as such may not be appropriate for all
  circumstances. See our Security article for more information

Check out our [Quick Setup Guide](/developers/guides/quick/ "Quick") for
simple instructions that walk you through how to get set up with Tag
integrations.

From an additional security perspective, consider using the Limits
functionality to restrict your integration by IP address, service and/or
URL. See our Security article for more details.

#### API Integrations

All Loqate products can be integrated using our APIs, which are also
available for Address Verification, Email Verification and Phone
Verification for more flexible integrations.

**Pros:**

- **Control:** you\'re not constrained by any existing integrations or
  ways of working, and you don\'t need to rely on our preset JavaScript
  or CSS
- **Customisation:** you can shape your customer journey however you see
  fit

**Cons:**

- **Complexity:** API integrations require technical knowledge and
  resources
- **Speed:** it takes time to implement and test API integrations

Check out our [API documentation](/developers/apis/ "APIs") for details
of all of the Loqate APIs.

You can still take advantage of all of the security functionality
available in the Account Section - see our
[Security](/developers/getting-started/api-security/ "API Security")
article for more details.

#### Integrations by Platform

As well as the option of creating your own integration using the Tag
and/or API methods, we also have a range of pre-built integrations which
allow you to access Address Capture, Verify, Email Validation and Phone
Validation within various tools. We\'re always working on new
integrations, but some of our current integrations include:

- [Microsoft Dynamics
  365](https://www.loqate.com/en-gb/integrations/microsoft-dynamics-365/)
- [SAP](https://www.loqate.com/en-gb/integrations/sap-commerce-cloud/)
- [Shopware](https://www.loqate.com/en-gb/integrations/shopware/)

If you already use any of these tools, you can use our pre-built
integrations to quickly and easily add Loqate functionality to your
site.

Check out our [Integrations documentation](/guides/ "Guides") for
details of how to get up and running.
