## []{#who}Who should use this guide?

If you already have a form on your website and want to add Address,
Email or Phone Validation, this guide will get you up and running as
quickly as possible. We have made integrating our services as simple as
possible, with the majority of the process guiding you through step by
step. You are not expected to have any technical expertise, but a basic
understanding of HTML would be an advantage.

For more advanced, customised installations, please see our API pages:

- [Address validation API page](/developers/apis/)
- [Phone validation API page](/developers/apis/)
- [Email validation API page](/developers/apis)

## []{#how}How to use this guide

This guide covers how to integrate Address Validation, Email Validation
and Phone Validation. Much of the setup process is the same for all
three services - the following sections are universal across all three:

- Adding the Loqate Tag to your site
- Settings (although different services do have slight different options
  in some regards)

Some of the specific setup options and advanced customisation options
are unique to each service however, in which case we\'ve clearly marked
which sections are relevant to which service.

::::: {.row .tight}
:::: {.col-12 .justify-content-center}
::: {.col-12 .bg-oat .scroll-box}
Note that the **Adding the Loqate Tag to your
site** and **Setup** sections are required to get a service up and
running - the **Settings** and **Further Customisation** sections are
optional, however we do recommend you go through these when you first
set up each service.
:::
::::
:::::

## []{#tag}Adding the Loqate Tag to your site

To get started, [log into your Loqate
account](https://account.loqate.com/Login/), select **Add service** from
the top of the page then click the **Start setup** button under Address,
Email and Phone Verification.

::: screenshot

:::

![](https://cdn.gbgplc.com/lqt-website-legacy/media/5727/add-service-2.png?width=500&height=184.24657534246575)
:::

If you are integrating with any of [our pre-built
integrations](/en-gb/integrations/) such as Magento 2 select the **App**
option and choose the relevant application - your installation will be a
little different, so on the next step, you will be taken to the
associated app page where you can follow instructions for installation.
For everything else, select **Website** and enter the URL of the site
you\'re putting the service into. Click **Next** to continue.

::: screenshot
![](https://cdn.gbgplc.com/lqt-website-legacy/media/5728/add-service-3.png)
:::

Next you will be presented with a snippet of JavaScript code to add to
your website. Copy the code (or Tag) generated for you and paste it into
the \<head\> section in the HTML of your website.

::::: {.row .tight}
:::: {.col-12 .justify-content-center}
::: {.col-12 .bg-oat .scroll-box}
Tip: placing this tag on each page of your site makes the setup process
easier and is easy to do if you have a layout template for your site.
:::
::::
:::::

Once you have finished editing the page, save and upload the new file to
your servers and click the **Launch in-page setup** button on the setup
screen.

The setup process will now open your site using the URL provided
earlier, and display setup options on the right-hand side of the screen
(we\'ll refer to this during the setup process as the on-screen setup
section). The Tag setup will map the fields automatically - see the
**Setup** section below for more information specific to the three
different services.

## []{#setup}Setting up your service

Follow the instructions in the sections below to finish setting up
Address Validation, Email Validation and/or Phone Validation - the
specific steps to take differ depending on the service.

By default, the setup process will attempt to create all three services,
and you will see each of them listed in the on-screen setup section. If
you would only like to use one or two of these services, make sure to
disable the service(s) you won\'t be using, to make sure you don\'t set
up any unwanted services by accident.

::::: {.row .tight}
:::: {.col-12 .justify-content-center}
::: {.col-12 .bg-oat .scroll-box}
If at any point you get stuck or have questions regarding our products
or setup process, [please contact our support
team](https://www.loqate.com/en-gb/contact/) or chat with us live from
the setup screen.
:::
::::
:::::

For added security, we advise you to look at the service settings on
your account. You can find out the benefits of doing so in the
[Settings](#settings) section of this guide.

 

::::::::::::::::::: {.row .bg-oat .tight-top .no-bottom}
::: {.col-12 .no-padding .show-hide-content__trigger}
#### []{#av}Address Validation
:::

::::::::::::::::: {.col-12 .tight-bottom .show-hide-content__content .bg-white}
When your site loads at the end of the setup process, in the on-screen
setup section (on the right-hand side of the screen) you will see a list
of services available for your form. If one or more address fields have
been detected then the Address Validation service will be marked as
Active.

::: screenshot
![](https://cdn.gbgplc.com/lqt-website-legacy/media/5749/address-validation-1.png)
:::

Before looking at any configuration for your Address Validation you can
test whether everything is working by performing an address lookup:

- Start to type any part of an address into one of the address fields on
  your form
- A list of valid address should display below the field, matching as
  you type, like the example below:

::: screenshot
![](https://cdn.gbgplc.com/lqt-website-legacy/media/2183/address-validation-loqate.jpg)
:::

- The more you type, the more accurate the results will become
- Once you find the address you want, select it and the rest of your
  address fields should autofill

If everything works as you expect it to, you can now give your
installation a name so that you can reference it in the future.

- Scroll down to the bottom of the configuration screen to find the
  **Name** section
- Pick a name that makes it clear to anyone else where Address
  Validation is used - for example \'Website Registration Form Address
  Validation\'

Once that\'s done, you can press the **Save** button at the bottom of
the on-screen setup section, underneath the list of services. If the
Address Validation service isn\'t working as you\'d expect it to
however, or you want to make any changes, see the configuration section
below.\
\

### []{#config}Configuring the Address Validation Service {#Quicksetupguide–Address,EmailandPhoneValidation-ConfiguringtheAddressValidationService}

If you want to make any changes to how the address fields have been
mapped, or edit any other settings for the service, click
the **Configure** button against the Address Validation service to open
up a configuration screen.

::: screenshot
![](https://cdn.gbgplc.com/lqt-website-legacy/media/5750/address-validation-3.png)
:::

The two main functions of this screen are for:

- Mapping address fields
- Enabling Geolocation

**[]{#map}Mapping Address Fields**

If your form has one or more address fields and you've named your field
names or ids conventionally (i.e. Line1, Line2, City, etc), the Address
Validation service will try to match the correct field types to the
relevant address fields on your form. You can see how these have been
mapped under the **Fields** section of the configuration screen:

::: screenshot
![](https://cdn.gbgplc.com/lqt-website-legacy/media/5751/address-validation-2.png)
:::

From here you can edit the existing mapping or add entirely new fields.

Field types correspond to specific address components (i.e. Line1, Line
2, City, etc.) - see the **Available Field Types** section below for
information on the most common field types that you can use.

- To edit an existing field mapping, click the arrow next to the field
  name and select the relevant option from the drop-down list
- To create another field, click **Add a new field** and choose the
  relevant option under both *Your Fields* and *Our Fields*

For either of the above examples, instead of choosing a field from the
drop-down list you can click the selection button and then select the
field on your form that you want to use.\
If you need to remove any fields, click the bin icon on the right hand
side, next to the unwanted field.\
To the right of each fieldset is a button to access additional settings
for that field. There are four settings to choose from, which can be
mixed and matched as you please.

::: screenshot
![](https://cdn.gbgplc.com/lqt-website-legacy/media/1376/dot-menu.png)
:::

These settings are:

- **Search:** turns the field into a search bar, showing the returned
  address results when a user starts typing their address into the field
- **Populate: **fills in the field with the relevant data after an
  address is selected
- **Preserve: **once populated, the field is not changed by the address
  validation again. This can be useful if you need to manually make a
  change and make it persist on the form
- **Country: **turns the field into a country dropdown list

When you are happy with your setup, scroll to the bottom of the
configuration screen and click **DONE **and then try searching for an
address. If you are happy with the results, click **SAVE **at the bottom
of the on-screen setup section.

At this point, the Address Validation service will be live and running
on your website with all of the settings you have chosen. 

If there are any more places you would like to install a service, you
can click the **Add another service** drop-down menu and select a
service.

**[]{#types}Available Field Types **

Below is a table of the most commonly used fields available for Address
Validation: 

  ---------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Field name**         **Description**
  Line1-5                The specific line number of the returned address
  Town                   The Town of the returned address
  Sub Building           The Flat or Unit number within the building. i.e. Flat 1
  Street                 The Street Name of the returned address
  Search Input           Search bar where all the address validation magic happens
  Postcode               The Postcode of the returned address
  Formatted Address      The FULL address in the correct standardised format
  District               The locality within the Town or City
  County Name            The name of the County, Province or State, i.e. California
  County Code            The code of the County, Province or State, i.e. CA
  County                  The County of the returned address
  Country                 The ISO 3166 Country name for the returned address
  Company                Returns the full company name where registered
  Building Number        Number of the building for the returned address
  3-Character ISO Code   The ISO 3166 3-character Country Code for the returned address, i.e. GBR
  2-Character ISO Code   The ISO 3166 2-character Country Code for the returned address, i.e. GB
  ---------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

While these fields will be enough for the majority of use cases, this is
not a finite list and other fields and formats can be used.

**[[]{#geo}Geolocation]{.inline-comment-marker
ref="c82c2208-4add-4eec-83be-b389d78b2bb9"}**

It\'s also possible to allow address lookups to be based on the end
user\'s current location, using the Geolocation feature. For more
information about what Geolocation is and what the benefits are, [see
this
page](https://www.loqate.com/en-gb/address-verification/geolocation/){.external-link
rel="nofollow"}.

In order to access this additional functionality, do the following:

- Click the **Configure** button for your address validation service in
  the on-screen setup section
- Below the address mapping fields, you should see
  a **Geolocation** section with a toggle switch (this is set to OFF by
  default)

::: screenshot
![](https://cdn.gbgplc.com/lqt-website-legacy/media/5752/geolocation-1.png)
:::

- Toggle this switch to ON (showing the green background) to activate
  Geolocation on the service

Once you're ready, click **DONE **at the bottom of the configuration
screen and test your page. If you are happy with how the information is
being populated click the **SAVE **button at the bottom of the on-screen
setup section to complete all changes.

At this point, the Geolocation service will be live and running on your
website in addition to your address validation service.

### **[]{#off}Turn off Browser Autofill** {#Quicksetupguide–Address,EmailandPhoneValidation-TurnoffBrowserAutofill}

For the best experience when using the Address Validation service, we
recommend you turn off browser autofill functionality for address form
fields.

There are two ways in which we suggest you do this - you can use either
or both of these methods:

- **Method one:** below where you placed the Loqate Tag script on the
  page (i.e. in the \<HEAD\> section of your website), insert the
  following JavaScript code snippet: 

:::::: {.code .panel .pdl .conf-macro .output-block hasbody="true" macro-name="code"}

When your site loads at the end of the setup process, in the on-screen
setup section (on the right-hand side of the screen) you will see a list
of services available for your form. If an email address field has been
detected then the Email Validation service will be marked as Active.

:::

If you want to make any changes to how the email address field has been
mapped, or edit any other settings for the service, click
the **Configure** button against the Email Validation service to open up
a configuration screen.

The main thing to look at is the field mapping. If your form has an
email address field then it will automatically be detected and mapped to
the Email validation service - the field will show up as highlighted on
your form, and under **Fields** you will be able to see how it has been
mapped:

::: screenshot
![](https://cdn.gbgplc.com/lqt-website-legacy/media/2976/email-validation-field.png)
:::

If your email address field hasn\'t been mapped properly, you can change
this manually by selecting the relevant field from the **Your
Fields** dropdown.

If you\'re happy with how the email address field has been mapped, all
you need to do now is give your installation a name so you can reference
it in the future.

- Scroll down to the bottom of the configuration screen to find
  the **Name** section
- Pick a name that makes it clear to anyone else where email validation
  is used - for example \'Website Registration Form Email Validation\'

Once that\'s done, your Email validation setup is complete. Scroll to
the bottom of the configuration screen and click **DONE**, then scroll
to the bottom of the on-screen setup section and click **SAVE**. 

If there are any more places you would like to install a service, you
can click the **Add another service** drop-down menu and select a
service.

phone number against. If you include a Country field, the service will
automatically detect it and use the inputted country for validation
purposes.

## []{#settings}Settings

You can change your service settings and take further control over your
usage in the Account Section of your Loqate account
([account.loqate.com)](http://account.loqate.com).

To get to the settings options, from the landing page of your account
choose **Your Services** from the menu and then select the service you
want to look at.

::: screenshot
![](https://cdn.gbgplc.com/lqt-website-legacy/media/5746/settings-1.png)
:::

These settings break down into the following categories:

- [**Configuration**](#config2)
- [**Limits**](#limits)
- [**Mappings**](#map2)
- [**Data (Address Validation only)**](#data)
- [**Customise **](#custom)
- [**Advanced (available for the latest version of Capture
  only)**](#advanced)
- [**Setup**](#setup2)

Most of these are the same for each service, but we\'ll point out where
appropriate anything which is specific to just one or more of the
services.

The next sections of this guide will focus on each of the categories and
walk you through how to make the most of the options available to you.

**NOTE: If you make any changes, you will need to click
the *Save *button for those changes to take effect.**

### []{#config2}Configuration

The Configuration tab gives you the following options to adjust:

- **Name:** customise the name of the key selected. This is primarily to
  help you identify your own keys more easily, and can be particularly
  useful if you are using more than one key under one account
- **Status: **[toggle the key status to active/inactive - setting this
  to inactive will stop any services associated with that key from
  working on your site]{.inline-comment-marker
  ref="596c820e-1ec3-4c1c-b60d-440397fe9d28"}

ref="596c820e-1ec3-4c1c-b60d-440397fe9d28"}
:::

### []{#limits}Limits

The Limits tab helps you maintain control over who can use your keys and
which of your websites the service requests should be made from, and
place limits on the number of requests made by individual IP addresses.
We strongly recommend that you complete these settings.

::: screenshot
![](https://cdn.gbgplc.com/lqt-website-legacy/media/5741/limits-1.png)
:::

The settings can be used as follows:

- **Daily lookup limit: **the maximum spend level allowed on this
  installation per day. Set this to a sensible level that you do not
  want to go over and that won\'t affect expected daily usage
- **[Lookup limit per user]{.inline-comment-marker
  ref="6f64f6f1-f46c-4f85-8915-2902292bfc88"}:** the maximum number of
  lookups that an individual user can perform - calculated by IP
  address. By default this is set to **Unlimited**, but by toggling the
  slider you can set a maximum limit
  - **Limiter Exclusions:** when **Lookup limit per user** is toggled
    on, the **Limiter Exclusions** option is also enabled. This allows
    you to create a list of IP addresses which won\'t be affected by the
    per user limit - enter an IP address you wish to exclude in the text
    box and then click the plus icon. You can add as many IP addresses
    as you like

::: screenshot
![](https://cdn.gbgplc.com/lqt-website-legacy/media/5742/limits-2.png)
:::

- **Limit by URL:** to help prevent fraudulent or accidental use of one
  of your keys across domains, add the URLs that you expect the requests
  to be coming from. Enter a URL address you wish to limit in the text
  box and then click the plus icon. You can add as many URLs as you like
  - You will also need to specify any subdomains and combinations of
    URLs that might be used. [i.e. ]{.inline-comment-marker
    ref="561b2537-fb66-4ced-9f30-72fe1cb030c6"}[[mysite.co.uk]{.inline-comment-marker
    ref="561b2537-fb66-4ced-9f30-72fe1cb030c6"}](http://www.mysite.co.uk/){.external-link
    rel="nofollow"}[, ]{.inline-comment-marker
    ref="561b2537-fb66-4ced-9f30-72fe1cb030c6"}[[mysite.com]{.inline-comment-marker
    ref="561b2537-fb66-4ced-9f30-72fe1cb030c6"}](http://www.mysite.com/){.external-link
    rel="nofollow"}[, ]{.inline-comment-marker
    ref="561b2537-fb66-4ced-9f30-72fe1cb030c6"}[[mysite.co.uk]{.inline-comment-marker
    ref="561b2537-fb66-4ced-9f30-72fe1cb030c6"}](http://mysite.co.uk/){.external-link
    rel="nofollow"}[, e]{.inline-comment-marker
    ref="561b2537-fb66-4ced-9f30-72fe1cb030c6"}tc.
- **Limit by IP:** similar to the *Daily Limit*, this allows you to
  place request limits against a group of IP addresses, which should
  help manage your cashflow and cap individual usage. Enter an IP
  address you wish to limit in the text box and then click the plus
  icon. You can add as many IP addresses as you like
- **Limit by Service:** this allows you to restrict your key to one or
  more Loqate services for security purposes - we recommend matching
  this setting to the service you\'re using on that key
  (choose **Address Capture** for Address Verification)

::: screenshot
![](https://cdn.gbgplc.com/lqt-website-legacy/media/5743/limits-3.png)
:::

### []{#map2}Mappings

The Mappings tab allows you to edit the way your form fields are mapped
to the relevant Loqate service fields, without needing to go through the
setup process again.

If you\'re sure you know what each field\'s name is and how you want to
map it, this is a quick way of changing the mapping. If not, it may be
better to head to the **Setup** section (see below) and return to the
on-page setup process.

To make any changes, click on the edit icon
(![](https://cdn.gbgplc.com/lqt-website-legacy/media/5756/edit-icon.png?width=45&height=38){style="width: 45px; height: 38px; margin: 0; vertical-align: text-bottom;"})
next to the relevant field. You can then amend either of the fields, and
edit the Field Modes if required (see the Address Validation Setup
section for more information about Field Modes).

::: screenshot
![](https://cdn.gbgplc.com/lqt-website-legacy/media/5745/mappings-2.png)
:::

Alternatively, to add a new field just click on the **Add a
field** button.

### []{#data}Data

The Data tab allows you to select which additional datasets you want
returned for Address Validations, on an individual key basis. Note that
this tab is only visible for Address Validation keys, and not Email or
Phone Validation.

Alternatively, to apply Geolocation or Multi Residence data to all the
keys within your  account, within your Account Section
(account.loqate.com) you can go to **Your account** \> **Data
settings** and toggle the switches to enable the settings to be applied
to all keys. 

- **Geolocation: **next generation [geolocation
  technology](/en-gb/geocode){.external-link rel="nofollow"} that allows
  your mobile customers to find their location in a single tap
- **Multi Residence:** the [Multiple Residence
  dataset](/en-gb/datasets/multi-residence/){.external-link
  rel="nofollow"} from Royal Mail contains over 700,000 additional
  address records not recorded in PAF® of any premise where multiple
  households share a letterbox, such as apartment blocks

:::

### []{#custom}Customise

The Customise settings help you manage the localisation of your forms.
Under this tab you can control a range of settings, which differ
depending on the type of key - Address Validation keys have slightly
different settings to Email and Phone Validation.

#### []{#av2}Address Validation

You can customise Address Validation keys by adjusting country settings
and default languages, and setting URL restriction rules. Here are the
options:

::: screenshot
![](https://cdn.gbgplc.com/lqt-website-legacy/media/5730/address-validation-customise.png)
:::

- **Available countries:** use this to limit which countries are
  available to customers via the form. For each country you want lookups
  to be available for, start typing the name into the text field and
  select the relevant option from the list that appears. You can add as
  many countries as you need to this list. If you need to remove a
  country from the list, click on the X next to its name. 
  - **NOTE: the order in which countries appear within this list will be
    the same order they will appear on the address validation form**

::: screenshot
![](https://cdn.gbgplc.com/lqt-website-legacy/media/5729/address-validation-customise-1.png)
:::

- **Default country:** by default, Address Validation will try to
  determine which country your customer is connecting from by looking up
  their IP address. You can override this and default to a country of
  your choice by selecting one from the dropdown list. This may be
  useful if you expect the majority of your customers come from one
  country
- **Language: **Address Validation results can be returned in a variety
  of languages that use Roman characters. By default, the language will
  be set to match the user's browser settings, but you can specify a
  language to use by selecting one from the dropdown list. Currently,
  Address Validation can support the following languages: Dutch, English
  (UK), English (Canada), English (US), French, German, Hungarian,
  Italian and Spanish
- **[Active URLs: ]{.inline-comment-marker
  ref="071754c0-dff8-4b36-9fde-05b9e19da751"}**[if no URLs are specified
  here, the service will attempt to trigger on any page where the
  relevant address/email/phone field(s) exist. Specifying one or more
  URLs will restrict the service to only running on those
  pages]{.inline-comment-marker
  ref="071754c0-dff8-4b36-9fde-05b9e19da751"}

#### []{#epv}Email and Phone Validation

Email and Phone Validation keys have slightly fewer customisation
options than Address Validation. Here are the options:

::: screenshot
![](https://cdn.gbgplc.com/lqt-website-legacy/media/5736/email-verification-customise-1.png)
:::

- **Use Minimal Layout?: **toggle this option on if you want to disable
  the visual adornments that display next to email/phone number fields
  to indicate successful/failed validation (i.e. tick or cross icons). 

::: screenshot
![](https://cdn.gbgplc.com/lqt-website-legacy/media/5735/email-validation-customise-1.png)
:::

- **A[ctive URLs:]{.inline-comment-marker
  ref="33a1bfa8-757f-434b-946f-dcfcdd8445dd"}**[ if no URLs are
  specified here, the service will attempt to trigger on any page where
  the relevant address/email/phone field(s) exist. Specifying one or
  more URLs will restrict the service to only running on those
  pages.]{.inline-comment-marker
  ref="33a1bfa8-757f-434b-946f-dcfcdd8445dd"}

### []{#advanced}Advanced

The Advanced tab contains two options which allow you to further
customise your searches. This tab is only visible if you\'re using the
latest version of Capture - earlier versions don\'t have access to the
functionality included within.

::: screenshot
![](/media/jgpfnykj/advanced-nov-2024.png){height="467" width="750"}
:::

#### []{#bias}Location Biasing

Enabling the Location Biasing feature results in reduced keystrokes and
a quicker address entry process for your customers.

Enabling the biasing feature is just a case of toggling the** Location
Biasing** switch to **On**.

::: screenshot
![](https://cdn.gbgplc.com/lqt-website-legacy/media/5732/bias-1.png)
:::

#### []{#filter}Filters

The Filters feature allows you to set up one or more filters to restrict
the results of your searches - i.e. to choose whether you want your
searches to include or exclude certain things.

::: screenshot
![](https://cdn.gbgplc.com/lqt-website-legacy/media/5737/filters-2-1.png)
:::

There are three components to each filter:

- **Filter name:** choose what you want to filter by - see the list
  below for details of each of the possible options
- **Qualifier:** choose **is** or **is not** to set whether you want to
  include or exclude results
- **Filter value:** set the specific value you want to include or
  exclude

For each filter you want to set up, fill in these three components and
click the **Add** button. You can create multiple filters, depending on
what you want to achieve.

::::::: {.row .tight}
:::::: {.col-12 .justify-content-center}
::: {.col-12 .bg-oat .scroll-box}
Note that if you include more than one filter, search results will need
to fulfil both/all filters before being included.
:::

Here is an example where two filters have been set up to allow for a
search of addresses in the city of Worcester, excluding any addresses
registered to Loqate (i.e. if you wanted to search a specific area but
exclude one or more organisations):

::: screenshot
![](https://cdn.gbgplc.com/lqt-website-legacy/media/5738/filters-3-1.png)
:::

NOTE: when using Filters we recommend always performing single-country
searches, so that any country-specific Filters will return relevant
results. Using Filters which aren\'t applicable to certain countries can
result in nothing being returned.

Here are the full details of the different filters available (note that
some are only available with US and CA data):

### []{#setup2}Setup

If at any point you need to change the way a service is set up on a
form, you can reactivate the setup process in this section.

:::

Click the **Activate setup** button to start the setup process again -
this will take you back through the setup process for [mapping your
address fields](/developers/guides/quick){.external-link
rel="nofollow"}.

You can also copy the Loqate tag from here, if you want to add it to
another site or another page on your current site.

## []{#further}Further customisation

Away from the Account Section, there are various ways in which you can
further customise your Address, Email and Phone Validation services.
We\'ll break these down by service below.

### []{#avc}Address Validation Customisation

#### []{#options}Custom options

If you want to customise the look and feel of Address Validation, there
is a variety of options that you can set. Below is an example of the
JavaScript snippet to include in your page to add the option for
customers to manually enter an address. For more information about the
available options, please get in touch with the Loqate support team.

:::::::::::::: {.row .tight}
::::::::::::: {.col-12 .justify-content-center}
:::::::::::: {.col-12 .bg-oat .scroll-box}
::: {.line .number1 .index0 .alt2 bidi-marker="true"}
\<script type=\"text/javascript\"\>
:::

::: {.line .number2 .index1 .alt1 bidi-marker="true"}
  pca.on(\"options\", function (type, id, options) {
:::

::: {.line .number3 .index2 .alt2 bidi-marker="true"}
    if (type == \"capture+\") {
:::

::: {.line .number4 .index3 .alt1 bidi-marker="true"}
      options.manualEntryItem = false;
:::

::: {.line .number5 .index4 .alt2 bidi-marker="true"}
    }
:::

::: {.line .number6 .index5 .alt1 bidi-marker="true"}
  });
:::

::: {.line .number7 .index6 .alt2 bidi-marker="true"}
\<script\>
:::

::: {.line .number7 .index6 .alt2 bidi-marker="true"}
:::

::: {.line .number7 .index6 .alt2 bidi-marker="true"}

#### []{#events}Custom events

If you call any custom methods or listen to events, you will need to
include a JavaScript snippet in your page to get a reference to the
control objects as they load. Below is an example which fires an alert
when a customer selects an address. For more information about the
listenable events which can be used in this way, please get in touch
with the Loqate support team.

::::::::::::::: {.row .tight}
:::::::::::::: {.col-12 .justify-content-center}
::::::::::::: {.col-12 .bg-oat .scroll-box}
:::::::::: {.line .number1 .index0 .alt2 bidi-marker="true"}
::: {.line .number1 .index0 .alt2 bidi-marker="true"}
\<script type=\"text/javascript\"\>
:::

::: {.line .number2 .index1 .alt1 bidi-marker="true"}
  pca.on(\"load\", function(type, id, control) {
:::

::: {.line .number3 .index2 .alt2 bidi-marker="true"}
    control.listen(\"populate\", function(address) {
:::

::: {.line .number4 .index3 .alt1 bidi-marker="true"}
      alert(\"User selected: \" + address.Id);
:::

::: {.line .number5 .index4 .alt2 bidi-marker="true"}
    });
:::

::: {.line .number6 .index5 .alt1 bidi-marker="true"}
  });
:::

::: {.line .number7 .index6 .alt2 bidi-marker="true"}
\<script\>
:::
::::::::::

::: {.line .number7 .index6 .alt2 bidi-marker="true"}
:::

::: {.line .number7 .index6 .alt2 bidi-marker="true"}

#### []{#load}Loading problems

If Address Validation is not loading at the correct time, you can
include this snippet in your page (directly below your address fields):

:::::::: {.row .tight}
::::::: {.col-12 .justify-content-center}
:::::: {.col-12 .bg-oat .scroll-box}
::: {.line .number1 .index0 .alt2 bidi-marker="true"}
\<script type=\"text/javascript\"\>
:::

::: {.line .number2 .index1 .alt1 bidi-marker="true"}
​pca.load();​
:::

::: {.line .number3 .index2 .alt2 bidi-marker="true"}
\<script\>
:::
::::::

### []{#evc}Email Validation Customisation

If you would like to perform an action based on the response from the
Email Validation service, you can use our data event listener as
follows:

:::::::::::: {.row .tight}
::::::::::: {.col-12 .justify-content-center}
:::::::::: {.col-12 .bg-oat .scroll-box}
::: {.line .number1 .index0 .alt2 bidi-marker="true"}
pca.on(\"data\", function(type,id,data){
:::

::: {.line .number2 .index1 .alt1 bidi-marker="true"}
    if (type === \"emailvalidation\"){
:::

::: {.line .number3 .index2 .alt2 bidi-marker="true"}
        if(data=== false){
:::

::: {.line .number4 .index3 .alt1 bidi-marker="true"}
            //your code here
:::

::: {.line .number5 .index4 .alt2 bidi-marker="true"}
        };
:::

::: {.line .number6 .index5 .alt1 bidi-marker="true"}
    };
:::

::: {.line .number7 .index6 .alt2 bidi-marker="true"}
});
:::

### []{#pvc}Phone Validation Customisation

If you would like to perform an action based on the response from the
Phone Validation service, you can use our data event listener as
follows:

:::::::::::: {.row .tight}
::::::::::: {.col-12 .justify-content-center}
:::::::::: {.col-12 .bg-oat .scroll-box}
::: {.line .number1 .index0 .alt2 bidi-marker="true"}
pca.on(\"data\", function(a,b,c){
:::

::: {.line .number2 .index1 .alt1 bidi-marker="true"}
    if (a === \"mobilevalidation\"){
:::

::: {.line .number3 .index2 .alt2 bidi-marker="true"}
        if(c=== false){
:::

::: {.line .number4 .index3 .alt1 bidi-marker="true"}
            //your code here
:::

::: {.line .number5 .index4 .alt2 bidi-marker="true"}
        };
:::

::: {.line .number6 .index5 .alt1 bidi-marker="true"}
    };
:::

::: {.line .number7 .index6 .alt2 bidi-marker="true"}
});
