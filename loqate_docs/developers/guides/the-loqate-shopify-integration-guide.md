rel="noopener" target="_blank"}\
\

The Loqate Shopify Plus Integration, downloadable via the Shopify App
Store, allows you to quickly and easily add Loqate\'s address validation
services to the checkout page of your Shopify Plus site. With some or
all of these services enabled you can provide your customers with
type-ahead lookup functionality for address fields (reducing both input
times and the likelihood of errors), verification for manually-entered
addresses, and email address validation.

We\'ve created this integration to take advantage of Shopify\'s new
Checkout Extensibility functionality, which means you can leverage
Shopify\'s latest technology as part of the Loqate app.

Installing and setting up this Shopify Plus app is a straightforward
process, and in this guide we will take you through the handful of quick
steps required to get up and running. You don\'t need any in-depth
technical knowledge in order to install this app, just familiarity with
Shopify Plus.

## Available services: Address Capture, Address Verify and Email Validation {#TheLoqateShopifyPlusIntegrationIntegrationGuide-AddressCaptureandAddressVerify}

The Loqate Shopify Plus Integration includes three Loqate services:

- **Address Capture**, which provides a type-ahead solution for address
  input
- **Address Verify**, which ensures the accuracy of manually-entered
  addresses
- **Email Validation**, which ensures the accuracy of customer email
  addresses

Read on to find out more about what each service does, and how they
complement each other.

NOTE: these services are designed to work together, but each one can be
enabled/disabled individually. Address Capture is enabled by default,
but while it\'s not recommended it is possible to disable Address
Capture and use just Address Verify and/or Email Validation. See the
\'[Use without Address Capture](#UseWithout){anchor="#UseWithout"}\'
section below for more details.

#### Address Capture

This is active by default once you\'ve installed and configured the app,
adding type-ahead address lookup functionality to the Address field on
your checkout form and allowing customers to start typing in their
address and then select the relevant one from a list of suggested
addresses.

Address Capture is available in both the Delivery address and Billing
address sections.

#### []{#AddressVerify}Address Verify

If enabled, Address Verify adds an extra layer of verification by
checking addresses against our reference data using a process of
correction, standardisation, formatting, enhancement and verification.
If appropriate, it can then offer an alternative which the customer can
either agree to use, or dismiss in favour of their original entry.

Address Verify is available on the [Thank You page, post-checkout, and
can make changes to customers\' delivery addresses (it doesn\'t affect
the billing address).]{.inline-comment-marker
ref="d3db6574-92c2-463f-b171-7449d529b90c"}

[**NOTE:** Address Verify can also be added to the Delivery address
section of the checkout page, but this option is now deprecated and will
be removed in time. We strongly recommend that you don\'t use Address
Verify to the checkout page, and **only** use the post-checkout option,
as this allows you to use Address Verify alongside functions such as
wallets (for Apple/Google Pay) and logged-in users. If you already have
Address Verify enabled for the checkout page, we recommend you disable
this and enable the post-checkout option
instead.]{.inline-comment-marker
ref="d3db6574-92c2-463f-b171-7449d529b90c"}

#### Email Validation

This is an optional feature which, if enabled, allows you to validate
customer email addresses as they\'re being entered. If a customer enters
an invalid email address\*, they will be notified that the email address
can\'t be validated and won\'t be able to proceed through the checkout
form until they enter a valid email address.

Otherwise, customers who enter valid email addresses will not have their
experience interrupted or visually altered in any way.

\*See the \'Response fields\' section of the [Email Validation API
documentation](https://www.loqate.com/developers/api/emailvalidation/){rel="noopener"
target="_blank"} for details of why an email address might be invalid.

::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
## Prerequisites

Before you start installing and setting up the Loqate Shopify Plus
Integration, you will need the following:

- A live Shopify Plus account
- A live Loqate account
- A new Loqate API key (see the API keys section below for more
  information on this)

 
:::

::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
### Loqate accounts

You can use the Loqate Shopify Plus app with both the Loqate Saas
platform (available to North American customers) and Classic platform.
If you\'re in the US and you\'re not sure which platform you\'re using,
see our [guide to the Loqate Saas
Platform](https://www.loqate.com/developers/guides/the-loqate-saas-platform/){.external-link
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}.

It\'s important to note, however, that Address Verify functionality is
only available via the Classic platform. You can use both Address
Capture and Address Verify with a single Classic platform API key. 

 
:::

::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
### API keys {#TheLoqateShopifyPlusIntegrationIntegrationGuide-APIkeys .heading-element}

You\'ll need a new Loqate API key, dedicated to this service (our
[Creating API Keys
page](https://www.loqate.com/developers/getting-started/creating-api-keys/){.external-link
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} has lots of information about how to set
one up, and what to consider when you\'re doing that). For the Loqate
Saas platform you can use any key; for the Classic platform we recommend
you create a *generic* API key, but any key will work.

For information about how to ensure your Loqate integration is as secure
as possible, see our [API
Security](https://www.loqate.com/developers/getting-started/api-security/){.external-link
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} page.

## Installation

There are a few quick steps to get the Loqate Shopify Plus Integration
up and running:

- Install and configure the Loqate app (which you can find
  [here](https://apps.shopify.com/loqate){rel="noopener"
  target="_blank"})
  - [Basic setup](#Basic){anchor="#Basic"}
  - [Enabling Address
    Capture](#EnablingCapture){anchor="#EnablingCapture"}
  - [Enabling Address Verify](#EnablingVerify){anchor="#EnablingVerify"}
  - [Enabling Email Validation](#EnablingEmail){anchor="#EnablingEmail"}

  recommended)
- [Advanced Settings](#Advanced){anchor="#Advanced"}

Follow these steps in order, and you\'ll get up and running quickly and
easily. If you need help you can
contact [support@loqate.com](mailto:support@loqate.com){.external-link
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}.

 
:::

::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
### []{#Installing}Installing and configuring the Loqate app

The initial setup will add the Loqate app to your Shopify store, at
which point Address Capture will be enabled by default. You can then
also enable Address Verify and/or Email Validation.

#### []{#Basic}Basic setup

First, install [the Loqate
app](https://apps.shopify.com/loqate){rel="noopener" target="_blank"}
from the Shopify App Store (see the [Shopify app installation
instructions](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/apps/installing-apps){.external-link
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} for more details). Once that is done:

- You should automatically be taken to the Admin section for your new
  Loqate app

- If not, go
  to [accounts.shopify.com](https://accounts.shopify.com/){.external-link
  rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, select the **Your store** option,
  then select the **Loqate** app on the left-hand side of the screen to
  open it

![](/media/5ebdx3mk/loqate-app.png?rmode=max&width=240&height=482){height="482"
width="240"}

- Copy and paste your Loqate API key in to the *API Key* field on this
  screen, then click the **Save** button:

![](/media/3safadd5/api-key-july-24.png?rmode=max&width=500){height="92"
width="500"}

With that done, you can add one or more of the Loqate services to your
store using the steps below.

 
:::

::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
#### []{#EnablingCapture}Address Capture

With the app installed, Address Capture is automatically available.
There is, however, an additional step to make sure Address Capture is
added to your checkout. Here are the steps to follow:

- In the Admin section of your Shopify Plus account, go to
  **`Settings > Checkout`**. From here you can either edit your existing
  checkout, or create a new draft of your checkout layout
- To edit your existing checkout click the **Customize** button, or to
  create a new draft checkout click the **Duplicate** button followed
  by **Customize** on the new version

![](/media/qcodpqsz/duplicate-checkout.png?rmode=max&width=500){height="206"
width="500"}

- Once you\'re editing your checkout, go to the Settings menu (the cog
  icon on the left-hand side), scroll down to the **Address
  autocompletion** section and select the **Loqate** option to set
  Loqate as your provider:

![](/media/iyufdbh5/address-autocompletion.png){height="696"
width="432"}

- Make sure you save the changes to your checkout, then exit the editor.
  If you created a new checkout draft, you can click
  the **Publish** button to make it live

Address Capture will now be available on your checkout. If you also want
to enable Address Verify and/or Email Validation, carry on through the
next sections.

 
:::

::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
#### []{#EnablingVerify}Address Verify

There are a few steps required to enable Address Verify functionality to
your checkout:

First, you need to add the **Loqate-Checkout** app block to your store
(see [https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/blog/customize-shopify-checkout](https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/blog/customize-shopify-checkout){.external-link
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}). App blocks allow you to customise the
look and functionality of your checkout layout and process, and this
block is required in order to use Address Verify on the Thank You page.
Here\'s how to add this block:

- In the Admin section of your Shopify Plus account, go
  to `Settings > Checkout`. From here you can either edit your existing
  checkout, or create a new draft of your checkout layout (see the
  Address Capture section above for more details)
- Next, select the Apps icon (the bottom icon) in the left-hand menu of
  the checkout editor, then search for \'Loqate\'
- Select the **loqate-checkout** app, then click the plus button and
  select **Thank you** from the drop-down list - this adds the app block
  to the Thank You page

![](/media/e5sb0m1q/add-app-block.png?rmode=max&width=500){height="397"
width="500"}

- With that done, make sure you save the changes to your checkout, then
  exit the editor. If you created a new checkout draft, you can click
  the **Publish** button to make it live.

The next step is to disable the default address verification by Shopify.
If this is left enabled, additional suggestions may be displayed against
individual address fields, which can cause confusion for customers.

- Still in Settings \> Checkout, scroll down to the **Address collection
  preferences** section:

![](/media/3s2jd4di/address-collection-small.png?rmode=max&width=500){height="242"
width="500"}

- Make sure the **Validate shipping address** option is unticked, then
  click the **Save** button

The final step is to enable Address Verify in the Loqate app\'s Admin
page. 

**NOTE:** Address Verify is only available if you\'re using a Classic
platform API key. If you\'re using a Saas platform API key, the Address
Verify section below the API key section will remain greyed out.

If you\'re using a Classic platform API key, once you\'ve entered your
key into the API Key field in the Loqate app\'s Admin page, the Address
Verify section below will become editable:

![](/media/dpzh0ajv/verify-1-december-2024.png){height="186"
width="1000"}

- Scroll down to the Address Verify section and select the **Enable
  address verification for post checkout** option
  - NOTE: to use the post checkout option, please ensure your store is
    not [password
    protected](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/password-page){rel="noopener"
    target="_blank"}
- If you also want to enable Address Verify on the checkout page you
  can select the **Enable address verification for
  checkout** option too - this is not recommended, however, and this
  option will be removed soon
- Click the **Save** button, and Address Verify will now be available.

 
:::

::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
#### []{#EnablingEmail}Email Validation

The steps to enable Email Validation in your checkout are similar to
those for Address Verify.

First, add the **Loqate-Checkout** app block to your store - but this
time it needs to be added to the **Checkout** section.

- In the Admin section of your Shopify Plus account, go
  to `Settings > Checkout`. From here you can either edit your existing
  checkout, or create a new draft of your checkout layout (see the
  Address Capture section above for more details)
- Select the Apps icon (the bottom icon) in the left-hand menu of the
  checkout editor, then search for \'Loqate\'
- Select the **loqate-checkout** app, then click the plus button and
  select **Checkout** from the drop-down list

![](/media/5yacbhoy/add-app-block-2.png?rmode=max&width=500){height="397"
width="500"}

Once that\'s done, you just need to select the **Enable email
validation** option from the \'Email Validation\' section on the Loqate
app\'s Admin page:

![](/media/bllhuqmr/email-validation-december-2024.png){height="132"
width="1000"}

Once that\'s selected, click the **Save** button and move on to the next
section.

 
:::

::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
### []{#IncludeCompanyName}Recommended: include company name

By default, Shopify is set to not include a **Company name** address
field. As such, if an address includes a company name (for example if a
customer orders a delivery to their place of work) it won\'t be included
in the address that\'s populated in Shopify.

We recommend setting Shopify to include Company name as an optional
address field, so that it will be populated any time an address does
include a company name. Here\'s how to change that setting:

- Go to the site Settings page for your Shopify store 
- Select the **Checkout **option from the left-hand menu
- Scroll down to the **Customer information** section

![](/media/px3psvqc/company-name-settings.png?rmode=max&width=500){height="374"
width="500"}

- Set Company name to **Optional**, then click the *Save* button

With that done, you should now see an optional Company address field in
the checkout:

![](/media/04nbx3ge/company-name-1.png?rmode=max&width=500){height="343"
width="500"}
:::

::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
### []{#UseWithout}Optional: Use without Address Capture (not recommended)

We recommend always using Address Capture, as this helps reduce the
chances of mistakes caused by manual address entry, ensuring addresses
can be trusted as correct and giving the best customer experience. It
is, however, possible to use just Address Verification or just Email
Validation if you don\'t want any kind of address autocompletion
functionality. 

If you want to use Address Verification and/or Email Validation on their
own, follow the full installation and setup process as above, then you
can manually disable Address Capture. Here\'s how to do that:

- First, make sure that you\'ve enabled at least one of Address
  Verification and/or Email Validation (see the \'[Basic
  Setup](#Basic){anchor="#Basic"}\' section earlier)
- Then, go to Settings \> checkout and click the **Customize **option
  for your checkout
- Click on the **Settings **icon on the left-hand side, then scroll down
  to the **Address autocompletion** section

![](/media/iyufdbh5/address-autocompletion.png?rmode=max&width=288&height=464){height="464"
width="288"}

- Untick the **Use address autocompletion **option, then save the change
  to your Checkout configuration

This will have disabled the Address Capture functionality, while leaving
Address Verify and/or Email Validation running.

 
:::

::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
### []{#Advanced}Optional: Advanced Settings

The Advanced Settings page is located in the Admin section of your
Loqate app, and includes the following optional settings.

#### Display a custom Loqate capture address search input on the checkout page {#TheLoqateShopifyPlusIntegrationIntegrationGuide(lastupdated:23/01/25)-DisplayacustomLoqatecaptureaddresssearchinputonthecheckoutpage}

Selecting this option adds an additional \'Search for address\' field
onto the checkout page, which allows for containers to be used in
searching for addresses. Entering a street, road or apartment building
will where appropriate return a container displaying the number of
addresses:

![](/media/jqghuepc/containers-1.png?rmode=max&width=500){height="431"
width="500"}

Select an option from the list to see a list of addresses within the
container:

![](/media/k0afryff/containers-2.png?rmode=max&width=500){height="453"
width="500"}

Note that with this enabled, Verify will not fire on the Thank You page
when customers select addresses returned by Address Capture, unless they
subsequently edit a returned address.

#### Force addresses to be returned in latin character sets where available {#TheLoqateShopifyPlusIntegrationIntegrationGuide(lastupdated:23/01/25)-Forceaddressestobereturnedinlatincharactersetswhereavailable}

With this selected, Address Capture will always attempt to use any
English results to set the delivery address, even with non-latin
results. Note that for this setting to work, the \'Display a custom
Loqate capture address search input on the checkout page\' option must
be **enabled**.

For example, here\'s a Japanese address searched for using Kanji
characters:

![](/media/bginorp5/non-latin-1.png?rmode=max&width=500){height="477"
width="500"}

And here\'s the result populated using the English version of the
address:

![](/media/jjgfoobj/non-latin-2.png?rmode=max&width=500){height="232"
width="500"}

This is useful for when carriers have difficulty processing non-latin

## In use

Once the Loqate Shopify app is installed and configured, your customers
can start using Loqate\'s Address Capture service when inputting their
addresses. Here\'s an overview of what this looks like in practice,
using an example checkout page:

 
:::

:::::::: {.gd__i .section .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
::::::: {.section .gd__s}
:::::: {.gd__a style="--cols: 12;--cspan: 12; --rspan: 1;"}
::::: {.gd__c style="--cols:12"}
:::: {.gd__i .video .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
::: {.video-item .video-item--wistia .justify-content-center style="\"width:50%;height:50%!important;"}
:::

::::::::

::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
 

We\'ve also put together some screenshots of how that might look on an
example checkout page, to give you a sense of what to expect.

##### Address Capture

Here\'s what it looks like during an address lookup and after an address
has been selected in the Delivery address section:
:::

:::::::::::: {.gd__i .section .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
::::::::::: {.section .gd__s}
:::::::::: {.gd__a style="--cols: 12;--cspan: 12; --rspan: 1;"}
::::::::: {.gd__c style="--cols:12"}
::: {.gd__i .imageblock .v-align--centre .c6 style="--cspan:6;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
![](/media/cm1hwhxa/checkout-1-july-2024.png?rnd=133663824368670000){height="627"
loading="lazy" width="655"}
:::

::: {.gd__i .imageblock .v-align--centre .c6 style="--cspan:6;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
![](/media/gzridq54/checkout-2-july-2024.png?rnd=133663824371900000){height="650"
loading="lazy" width="654"}
:::

::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
And here\'s what it looks like during an address lookup and after an
address has been selected in the Billing address section:
:::

::: {.gd__i .imageblock .v-align--centre .c6 style="--cspan:6;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
![](/media/wftp34ts/billing-1-july-2024.png?rnd=133663824387530000){height="605"
loading="lazy" width="641"}
:::

::: {.gd__i .imageblock .v-align--centre .c6 style="--cspan:6;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
![](/media/04soukj4/billing-2-july-2024.png?rnd=133663824390630000){height="604"
loading="lazy" width="632"}
:::

::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
Note: the countries listed in the **Country/Region** dropdown list are
tied directly to what you\'ve set in the \'Shipping and delivery\'
section of your Shopify store settings. Therefore, if you only ship to
certain countries, only those countries will appear in the dropdown. If
a customer enters an address outside of those countries, Address Capture
will not be able to return suggestions in the country they\'re looking
for and Address Verify will not recognise the inputted address (see the
Address Verify section below).

##### Address Verify

If you have enabled Address Verify, this functionality will trigger on
the Thank You page after a customer has confirmed an order.

Immediately after the Thank You page loads, a message will appear saying
\"Please wait while we verify your address\...\":

![](/media/unnhseua/verify-thankyou-0.png?rmode=max&width=500){height="406"
width="500"}

This message will adjust depending on the results that Address Verify
can return, with three main possibilities:

- No changes required
- Alternative address found
- Address not validated

**No changes required**

If the customer\'s address is successfully verified with no changes
required, the Address Verify message will change to \"Your shipping
address has been verified!\":

![](/media/udncj4ci/verify-thankyou-01.png?rmode=max&width=500){height="140"
width="500"}

**Alternative address found**

If, however, Address Verify finds an alternative address to suggest, the
message will instead change to say \"We\'ve found an alternate
address\", and give the customer the option of either applying or
declining the proposed changes:

![](/media/pjfj0hc4/verify-thankyou-1.png?rmode=max&height=500){height="500"
width="387"}

If the customer clicks **Apply changes**, the message will change to say
\"Your shipping address has been updated\":

![](/media/ieipy1rf/verify-thankyou-2.png?rmode=max&width=500){height="320"
width="500"}

**NOTE:** customers will not see the updated address reflected on the
Thank You page, however if you check the Orders section of your Shopify
Plus account and find the transaction in question, you\'ll see that the
shipping address has been updated.

For example, here you can see that the billing address remains as it was
originally inputted, but the shipping address has been corrected by
Address Verify:

![](/media/agefgsl1/verify-thankyou-4.png?rmode=max&height=500){height="500"
width="317"}

You can also see evidence of the update in the order\'s timeline:

![](/media/fuvdkvcx/verify-thankyou-3.png?rmode=max&width=500){height="119"
width="500"}

Not all customers will choose to use the alternative addresses offered
by Address Verify, however. If a customer chooses to ignore the
suggestion, they will instead see a message which says \"Your shipping
address was not updated\":

![](/media/awqnzhl1/verify-thankyou-5.png?rmode=max&width=500){height="318"
width="500"}

**Address not validated**

Lastly, if an address is sufficiently low quality that Address Verify
can\'t validate it, the customer will instead see a message reading
\"Your shipping address could not be validated, your order will still be
processed.\"

![](/media/a3zf5qj3/verify-thankyou-6.png?rmode=max&width=500){height="312"
width="500"}
:::

::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
#####   Email Validation

If you have enabled Email Validation, this functionality will trigger
when a customer enters an invalid email address. Here\'s what that will
look like:

![](/media/trqlhvpd/email-validation-usage-august-2024.png){height="196"
width="700"}

When a customer enters a valid email address, this notification will
disappear and they will be able to proceed through the checkout.

## Troubleshooting

#####  

##### I can\'t see some of the Admin options described in this guide

The Loqate Shopify Integration requires a Shopify Plus account. If you
don\'t use Shopify Plus, you won\'t see all of the necessary options and
won\'t be able to use this integration.

##### The Capture autocomplete field is not showing on my checkout

Ensure that the API key is correct on the Admin page.

##### When selecting an address, the fields do not populate

Ensure that your API key is correct on the Admin page, and that you have
sufficient credit on your Loqate account.

##### How do I uninstall the Loqate app?** **

If you no longer want to use the Loqate Shopify Plus integration, you
can uninstall it from your Shopify Plus store.

**Please note:** if you uninstall the Loqate app and then want to start
using it again at a later date, you will need to go through the full
installation process again.

To uninstall the Loqate app, go to the Admin page of the app within your
Shopify account and click on the three dots at the top-right of the
screen. You will see an option to uninstall there:

![](/media/lbjptkog/uninstall.png?rmode=max&width=500){height="184"
width="500"}

When you click **Uninstall**, you\'ll be prompted to choose a reason for
uninstalling:

![](/media/jund5nxj/uninstall-2.png?rmode=max&width=500){height="195"
width="500"}

Select one or more reasons, then click the **Uninstall** button. This
will uninstall the app and return you to the \'Installed Apps\' section
of your Admin page.
