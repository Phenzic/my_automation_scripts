There are three main things to consider when planning an API integration
with Capture, to help ensure you get the most out of it, and
therefore the best return on investment: 

- The function of the integration itself 
- The look and feel of the visual elements 
- The mapping of the Loqate data back to your application/database 

The better you optimise all these points, the more likely your end users
are to quickly and intuitively find the address they are searching for.
This, in turn, helps you and your organisation to maximise your customer
journey KPIs. 

We\'ll look at all three points in this best practice guide, offering
suggestions for how to make the most of your integration along with
visual examples from a range of sample integrations.

Capture is designed to be a simple to use API with a straightforward
logical API flow, however there are some nuances to the consumption of
the API that are important to get right. Ensuring you\'re making the
most of all the functionality will help set up your end users for
success. 
:::
::::
:::::
:::::::::

::::::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
The basic flow of a Capture interaction works like this:

:::::: {.gd-steps .mtop--32}
::: gd-steps__steps
**1.** The user starts to type into an address lookup field

**2.** Trigger a Capture FIND request, passing the search terms to the
**Text** parameter

**3.** Present an initial set of results to the user, making sure both
the **Text** and **Description** fields are displayed

**4.** If the first result is what the user is looking for then they can
select that, but usually it won\'t be

**5.** As the user makes additional keystrokes, continue to submit FIND
requests and present each new set of results to the user

**6.** When the user sees a result they\'re looking for, they can click
on it to select the address or container

**7.** If the result that the user selects is a container (i.e. **Type =
Container**), pass the ID into the **Container** parameter and present
the addresses within that container as a new set of results

**8.** When the user selects an address (i.e. **Type** = **Address**)
perform a RETRIEVE request, passing the ID to the **ID** parameter, and
then populate the address fields on the form with the relevant data

::: gd-steps__endpoints
### Endpoints

Capture uses two endpoints:

- **Find:** used to narrow down a possible list of addresses
- **Retrieve:** used to retrieve a fully formatted address

See our [Address Capture APIs
page](https://www.loqate.com/developers/api/capture/){rel="noopener"
target="_blank"} for more details of these endpoints.

::: {.gd__i .rte .mtop--32 .mbtm--32 .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
### Additional considerations

- Make sure you display both the Text and the Description fields from
  the Find response to the user, as both will contain information
  necessary for an effective interaction 
- When performing a container drill-down, make sure you pass the ID of
  the selected record into a Find request within the container
  parameter 
- It is possible for there to be containers within containers 
- Populate the Origin parameter with the end user\'s IP address where
  possible and appropriate. This will help bias the results towards the
  user\'s location in countries where the Location Biasing functionality
  is available 
- Populate the Countries parameter where possible. This will help keep
  search results country-specific, and optimise the performance of the
  algorithm

## []{#LookAndFeel}Look and Feel

A key part of successfully utilising Capture is making sure the visual
elements of the integration help support the end users\' optimal usage -
good user experience helps users\' interaction with the search feel
intuitive and streamlined. Some key elements to consider include:

- [Single search field](#SingleSearchField)
- [Result layout](#ResultLayout)
- [Browser auto-fill](#BrowserAutoFill)
- [Utilise highlights](#UtiliseHighlights)
- [Visual container indicator](#VisualContainerIndicator)
- [Number of results](#NumberOfResults)
- [Mobile performance](#MobilePerformance)

![](/media/s4vp3gx1/look-and-feel-1.png){height="402" width="473"}
:::

::: left-col
### []{#SingleSearchField}1. Single search field

We recommend hiding your address fields at first. Displaying just a
single Address Lookup text box on the form can help indicate to the user
what is expected of them.

### []{#ResultLayout}2. Result layout

Consider the spacing of the information within each result, as well as
vertical space between each result. You want to make sure everything is
legible, and laid out in a way that the information is easily to digest
for the user. Ensure the text is of an appropriate font and colour, and
contrasts well with the background and wider website. If there is a
lengthy list of results, can the user scroll to get down to the one they
need?

### []{#BrowserAutoFill}3. Browser auto-fill

Most browsers will enable users to auto-fill forms without having to
manually enter information. Consider whether you want to allow this, and
if so, how that interaction would work alongside the address lookup. If
you allow users to fill in their address via their browsers auto-fill,
how will you validate that address is correct?

:::

::: right-col
### []{#UtiliseHighlights}4. Utilise highlights

The Find API provides a highlights field in the response, which helps
you identify characters within the result that match to the input search
term the user has provided. These characters can be **emboldened** to
better enable to identify the information they are searching for.

### []{#VisualContainerIndicator}5. Visual container indicator

Some results will be distinct addresses, while others may be a
container - i.e. a group of addresses. A visual indicator of a container
can help the user understand that if they click this result, they are
going to be presented with a further set of results. We find a simple
chevron serves well for this purpose.

::: right-col
![](/media/hqcf2z13/number-of-results-combined.png){height="286.5"
width="750"}
:::

::: left-col
### []{#NumberOfResults}6. Number of results

How many results you return to your users will have an impact on their
experience:

- A small number of results will mean users need to enter more of the
  address before the result they are looking for is displayed on the
  page
- A large list of results might cause the result they want to be hard to
  spot amongst all the others

7-10 results displayed is an optimal balance. You can manage this via
the Limit parameter within the API calls. To the right here you can see
the difference between returning a small list of results and a larger
list, in a sample integration.

### []{#MobilePerformance}7. Mobile performance

It\'s important that your integration behaves well on mobile, as that is
likely how many your users will be interacting with it. Optimise the
results for smaller screens, ensuring results are easily legible, whilst
trying to retain as many results on screen at once as possible. Too few
results displayed at once can make it harder for users to locate the
address they\'re looking for.\

## []{#AddressDataMapping}Address Data Mapping

Once the correct address has been retrieved, you want to make sure
you\'re mapping all of the necessary response fields back to your form
fields. That way you\'re making sure that the data going into your
database is comprehensive and valid. You also want to make sure that
your address form and backend systems support the length and type of
data that is likely to be returned within the countries and territories
that you operate in. 

### Address lines

Each country has different address conventions, with differing numbers
of address elements, and therefore different numbers (and lengths) of
required address fields. To ensure coverage across many countries, we
would suggest the following form fields as a minimum: 

- Company (if appropriate) 
- Line1 
- Line2 
- Line3 
- City 
- Postal code 
- State/Province (if appropriate) 
- Country (if appropriate) 

#### Company addresses

If your customers may be filling in commercial as well as residential
addresses, then the organisation name needs to be accounted for within
the layout of your form. Two common options for this are either:

- A separate field that can be filled in when appropriate
- As part of the address lines (in which case, ensure you have enough
  space remaining for the rest of the address information)

::::::::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
::::: split-cols
::: left-col
#### Field length {#CaptureIntegrationBestPractice-Fieldlength}

A lot of applications are limited on field length either by back-end
systems or shipping providers, and some countries\' address information
can include significantly longer address elements than others. Where
possible, we would recommend setting the length of address line fields
to 120+ characters.

:::::

::::: {.split-cols .v-align--centre .mbtm--32}
::: right-col
#### Character sets {#CaptureIntegrationBestPractice-Charactersets}

Different countries utilise distinctive character sets when writing
their addresses. Depending on the territories you are operating within,
you should consider what characters are likely to get populated into
your address fields, and how these can be best stored in line with any
limitations you have within your databases. The Loqate Capture product
supports the entire UTF8 character set.
