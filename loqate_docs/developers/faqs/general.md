Do you have an ISO certification?

::: content
Yes, GBG holds ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certification  -- An international
standard for information security.
:::

Can I add more than one person as a contact on my account?

::: content
Yes, if different people in your company deal with the service, e.g.
your accounts department and your website developer, it makes sense for
them to receive emails that relate to their job function. To add
contacts, [log into your account](https://account.loqate.com/) and click
on the Menu. Under Your Account \> Your details, select \'Manage
contacts\' and then click \'Add Contact\'.\
\
You can activate one or a mix of the tailored messages below for each
contact:

**Balance:** Receive a notification when your credit is running low.\
\
**Security:** Receive error and security notifications on your
account. \
\
**Billing:** Receive any finance-related updates such as invoices.
:::

Can I trial the service for free?

::: content
Yes, you can trial our services with no-obligation. Simply sign up for
an account and follow the instructions. We will give you a small amount
of credit so you can test services without spending anything.
:::

How often is data updated?

::: content
Royal Mail address data is updated every day. BACS and credit card data
is refreshed every month and data for route planning and international
address capture is updated every quarter.
:::

Do you offer a Service Level Agreement?

::: content
Our target uptime is 99.999%, including planned maintenance. Service
Level Agreements are available to Premium Customers. There is a charge
for this service.
:::

Do you provide development accounts to allow me to create my
integration?

::: content
Yes we do, although we can't provide unrestricted development accounts
under the terms of our agreement with our data providers. However,
within reason, we can provide you with test credit for development
purposes. We also have a postcode: WR5 3DA - which you can use for
repetitive testing without consuming credit. If you require a
high-volume test environment please [contact us](/en-gb/contact/) to
discuss your options.
:::

How can I update the details you hold for my company?

::: content
It's important that we hold the right details in your account to keep
the service running smoothly. You can check and update your information
by [logging into your account](https://account.loqate.com/), clicking on
your Account number and choosing \"Details\". Alternatively, if you
[contact us](/en-gb/contact/), we can update your details for you.
:::

How do you ensure the service stays Live at all times?

::: content
Service continuity is of prime important to us. That\'s why we\'ve taken
considerable steps to ensure that Loqate is always available:

- 2 completely autonomous data centres
- Load balanced servers in each data centre
- Data centres employ fully diverse routing and multiple carriers
- Automatic failover between servers and between data centres
- No single point of failure

All this means that even a catastrophic failure of a data centre can be
tolerated and will not impact on the availability of Loqate Predict.
Traffic will simply reroute to the other data centre within 60 seconds.
:::

Is the service offline when upgrades or data updates are applied?

::: content
No, upgrades and data updates are seamless and there is no downtime when
they are applied.
:::

I forgot my account number/password. Can you help?

::: content
Please [contact us](/contact) if you don\'t know, or have forgotten,
your account number or password. We should be able to find them from
your company name, email address or postcode.
:::

I received an error message when trying to access the service, what
should I do?

::: content
We have a [comprehensive
list](/developers/faqs/common-account-errors/ "Common account errors"){rel="noopener"
target="_blank"} of error messages and their resolutions. If that
doesn\'t help, you can contact our support team and we'll be happy to
help you.
:::

I use your on-premise solution. Can you offer me a backup?

::: content
Yes, any customer using an on-premise service can hook into the hosted
service if you have a problem with your own servers. This is simply a
case of changing the IP address that the service points towards.
:::

Can I use my Loqate account for more than one website/service?

::: content
Yes, there\'s no need to register for each website or service you want
to use; in your account you can create separate \'keys\' for use on
different websites or even different businesses. If you are integrating
our services for clients on different projects you might like to
consider creating a [reseller
account](/en-gb/partners/reseller/ "Reseller") where you can manage
\'child\' accounts separately.
:::

What is the average response time of the service?

::: content
This depends on a number of things, including both the service you are
accessing and your internet connection. Typical response times are less
than 40 milliseconds.
:::

What level of support do you provide?

::: content
We provide phone and email support during working hours (08.45-17.30
GMT, Monday to Friday. We also offer limited email support at the
weekends. Service level agreements are available for priority support,
please [contact
us](https://www.loqate.com/en-gb/contact/customer-support/#form){anchor="#form"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} for details.
:::

What service availability do you provide?

::: content
Since 2006 we have delivered 100% uptime -- that includes service
upgrades and planned maintenance.
:::

How will I know when my licence needs renewing?

::: content
All our licences are valid for a year. We will automatically invoice you
when your licence is due for renewal (typically around 60 days before -
to give you plenty of time to process payment).
:::

I don't need my Loqate service any more, what do I do?

::: content
There is no obligation to keep using our service. Annual user licences
will simply stop working, as will pay-as-you-go credit. We do not
provide refunds for any unused credit on your account. If you have been
supplied with raw data, in order to comply with Royal Mail licensing you
will need to complete a Data Destruction Form - confirming that you
won't use the data once your licence expires. Please [contact
us](/en-gb/contact/ "Contact") for more information if this affects you.
:::

I have many employees but they don't all need your service, do I have to
buy a user license for them all?

::: content
No you don't. Many Loqate services work on a pay-per-click (PPC) basis,
so you buy credit that's shared by everyone that needs it. If you need
user licences, then you need the correct number of licences for the
number of staff using the service. We can advise you of the most cost
effective option for your business if you [contact
us](/en-gb/contact/ "Contact").
:::

I've renewed my licence but why am I still getting \"Licence key is no
longer valid\" alerts?

::: content
Sometimes when you renew your annual licence, a new licence key will be
generated, rather than extending the existing licence (typically when
the renewal is done at the last minute, or if payment is late). To
reactivate the service, simply drop in the new key. This will have been
emailed to you when you renewed the service. If you are unsure of the
key you can view it by [logging into your
account](https://account.locate.com) and selecting \'All services\'. If
you would prefer to have the old key reactivated, please [contact
us](/contact/) and we\'ll see if we can help.
:::

I've accepted your End User Licence Agreement (EULA) why are you asking
me to accept another from a different provider?

::: content
The data that we provide to you is owned by other suppliers such as:
Royal Mail and Ordnance Survey. As an approved reseller, Loqate must
ensure our customers comply with the terms of business of our data
providers. This is why you might need to sign an extra licence
agreement.
:::

What is my account code?

::: content
You can find your account code in the \'Welcome to Loqate\' email that
is sent to you upon registration. This is a unique code and you will
need it to log in, so make sure to keep it safe. Accidentally deleted
the email? Don\'t worry, just [contact our Support
team](https://www.loqate.com/en-gb/contact/customer-support/#form "Support"){anchor="#form"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} and they will help.
