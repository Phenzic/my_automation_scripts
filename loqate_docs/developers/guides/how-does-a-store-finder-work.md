[]{#intro}In principle, a Store Finder tool works by allowing you to
combine precise location information for your organisation\'s stores and
a customer\'s location, then determining the relationship between the
two sets of information, and presenting the results in a visual fashion.

The key elements that you need in order to make a Store Finder work are:

- A list of locations (generally referring to your stores, but this
  could be any other locations relevant to your business and your
  customers such as collection points or drop-off lockers)
- Additional (optional) useful information about each location
- Your customer\'s current location
- A method for identifying which of your locations are closest to your
  customer - calculated using either distance or time metrics, depending
  on what your customer wants
- A method of visually presenting this information, and allowing the
  customer to select specific locations and see relevant information
  about each one

This sort of tool (or combinations of its components) can be used in
lots of different ways, but for the purposes of this article we\'re
going to focus on the Store Finder use case.

### []{#how}How do Loqate APIs interact to build a Store Finder?

The Loqate Store Finder product is comprised of a series of APIs which
interact with each other to fulfil all of the steps mentioned above. In
this section we\'ll go into a little more detail about how this works.

The APIs in question fall into the following categories (click on the
links below if you want to read the relevant API reference
documentation):

- Location Management:
  - [Create
    List](/developers/apis/location-services/location-management-create-list/ "Location Management Create List")
  - [Update List or
    Point](/developers/apis/location-services/location-management-update-list-or-point/ "Location Management Update List or Point")
  - [Delete List or
    Point](/developers/apis/location-services/location-management-delete-list-or-point/ "Location Management Delete List or Point")
  - [Get
    List](/developers/apis/location-services/location-management-get-list/ "Location Management Get List")
- [Global
  Geocoding](/developers/apis/location-services/global-geocoding/ "Global Geocoding")
- [Distance
  Finder](/developers/apis/location-services/global-distance-finder/ "Global Distance Finder")
- [Mapping](/developers/apis/location-services/map-tile-api/ "Map Tile API")

Here\'s a diagram to show how the APIs fit together in a finished Store
Finder:

Let\'s take a closer look now at how they work.

#### []{#locationmanagement}Location Management

The first thing you need to decide where you will host your list of
stores or locations that you want your customers to visit. There are
three options for doing this:

- Upload one or more lists in a CSV format via your account
  ([www.account.loqate.com](http://www.account.loqate.com){rel="noopener"
  target="_blank"}). This method requires no technical skills, and is
  generally better for lists that don\'t need changing or updating
  frequently, and that you\'re happy to update manually
- Upload one or more lists via the [Create List
  API](/developers/apis/location-services/location-management-create-list/ "Location Management Create List"){rel="noopener"
  target="_blank"}. This method is generally better if you have a list
  that requires updating frequently, or you want to programmatically
  create and edit lists rather than doing this manually
- Host a list yourself or with a third party. If you don\'t want to send
  us your locations, or you already have them stored elsewhere, you can
  simply pass the co-ordinates of your locations (and any other optional
  information) to our [Distance Finder
  API](/developers/apis/location-services/global-distance-finder/ "Global Distance Finder"){rel="noopener"
  target="_blank"} later on

Regardless of which method you choose, this list will form the basis of
your Store Finder. At this point you can also append information about
each store, such as opening hours, or contact details - this information
can then be displayed to your customers at a later point.
:::

::::: {.gd__i .tile .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
:::: {.tile-item .bg-sulphur-100 .tile-item--w-border .tile-item--horizontal style="--b:var(--cl-sulphur-400);"}
::: tile__content
It\'s crucial that we have co-ordinates for each of your stores, for use
later on in the process. If you have addresses but not co-ordinates,
don\'t worry - we can append them for you when you upload. You can
either request this as a parameter when you call the Create List API, or
select it as an option in your account.

::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
If you need to make changes to any of your lists (or individual location
points within one of them) then you can also do that, using one of the
following APIs:

- Make changes using the [Update List or Point
  API](/developers/apis/location-services/location-management-update-list-or-point/ "Location Management Update List or Point"){rel="noopener"
  target="_blank"}
- Delete lists you don\'t want/need any more using the [Delete List or
  Point
  API](/developers/apis/location-services/location-management-delete-list-or-point/ "Location Management Delete List or Point"){rel="noopener"
  target="_blank"}
- See the details of all the locations within a list using the [Get List
  API](/developers/apis/location-services/location-management-get-list/ "Location Management Get List"){rel="noopener"
  target="_blank"}
:::

::::: {.gd__i .tile .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
:::: {.tile-item .bg-turquoise-100 .tile-item--w-border .tile-item--horizontal style="--b:var(--cl-turquoise-300);"}
![](/media/z0kd4chj/support-customer.svg?rnd=133277664854600000){loading="lazy"}

::: tile__content
If you have stores in multiple regions you can either create multiple
lists for each region, or combine them into one. Creating multiple
smaller lists can be beneficial to improve performance, and help manage
different Store Finders for different countries.

#### []{#geocoding}Geocoding

Once you have at least one list of your stores, the next thing to do is
to identify your customer\'s current location.

The [Global Geocoding
API](/developers/apis/location-services/global-geocoding/ "Global Geocoding"){rel="noopener"
target="_blank"} takes a customer\'s address, post code or locality
(inputted by the customer into an appropriate field on your website),
and returns a set of co-ordinates identifying where that location is in
the world.

You can then take these co-ordinates and pass them into our Distance
Finder API in the next step.

#### []{#distance}Distance Finder

At this point in the process you have the locations of each of your
stores, and the location of your end user. The next task is to identify
which of your stores are closest to your customer, so that you can (in
the next step) present the most appropriate options back to them.

We can can calculate this for you by passing the following two pieces of
information into our [Global Distance Finder
API](/developers/apis/location-services/global-distance-finder/ "Global Distance Finder"){rel="noopener"
target="_blank"}:

- The co-ordinates of your customer that you received from our Geocoding
  API
- Either the ID of your Location List, or the locations (via an array
  including ID, name and lat/long co-ordinates for each) that you have
  passed to use as part of the API request

\
This API will return all the stores within a given radius, along with
any other information you have chosen to supply about those stores. It
will also provide the road-based distance and travel time between your
customer and each of your stores.

Road-based distances are preferential to straight line distance
calculations, as they give a more realistic and precise view of how far
away a store actually is. With straight line distances, geographic
features such as bodies of water or non-traversable land are ignored,
meaning that a customer could be pointed towards a store that isn\'t
actually their closest one, giving them a worse experience. 

Travel time is also a useful metric for customers as it allows them to
quickly relate to the distances being shown. For example, if a store is
15 minutes away a customer can quickly determine whether they could make
it there and back on their lunch break, increasing their chances of
visiting the store. 

You can then render these results as part of a side bar in your Store
Finder, allowing users to see a list of your stores and any other
relevant information.

#### []{#mapping}Mapping

Lastly, you need a way of presenting this information to your end user
on a map so that they can physically see where each store is located.

The [Map Tile
API](/developers/apis/location-services/map-tile-api/ "Map Tile API"){rel="noopener"
target="_blank"} allows you to retrieve map tiles for given
co-ordinates. In combination with a map renderer library such as
Maplibre or Leaflet this can be used to display your store locations on
them.  As we are only providing the basemap data and the tiles you are
free to style your locations based on your own site design.

appropriate points on this page. Follow those links to read more about
each of the individual APIs.
