This guide will take you through the steps require to install and
configure the Loqate Dynamics 365 integration in your Dynamics 365
instance.
:::

::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
## Prerequisites

In order to install and configure the Loqate Dynamics 365 integration
you will need the following:

- The Loqate solution zip file
- A Loqate API key (for more information see our [Creating API Keys
  page](/developers/getting-started/creating-api-keys/ "Creating API keys"){rel="noopener"
  target="_blank"})
- Administrative access to your Dynamics 365 environment
:::

::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
## **Installation** {#installation .p1}

Installing the Loqate Dynamics 365 integration involves the following
steps:\
\

1.  [Import the solution](#Import){anchor="#Import"}
2.  [Configure your forms to use Loqate
    controls](#Config){anchor="#Config"} (for each form you can add
    controls for Email Verification, Phone Verification and Address
    Search)

\
We will talk you through how to complete each step, using a standard
contact form as an example (you can then apply the same process to each
of your forms as required).
:::

::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
## []{#Import}Importing the solution {#importing-the-solution .p1}

- From your Dynamics 365 environment select Settings \> **Advanced
  Settings**. This will open your Business Settings in a new tab
- From the Customisation section of the menu, select **Solutions**
- Select **Import Solution**

![](/media/hoahafuf/d365-install-1s.png){height="486" width="1000"}

- A menu will appear allowing you to browse for the Loqate solution zip
  file - select this and click **Next**
- The version of the solution you\'re importing will display, and you
  will see a warning if you\'re updating an existing installation to a
  new version, or installing a version you've already installed
  previously

![](/media/rn0pl5jc/d365-install-2s.png){height="486" width="1000"}

- Select **Import**
- A bar will appear at the top of the page reading \'Currently importing
  solution "loqate_dynamics".\'

![](/media/m2xhqqux/d365-install-3s.png){height="486" width="1000"}

- If you need to navigate away while this is importing, you can - the
  process will run in the background
- Once the import is complete, the progress bar will turn green and read
  \'Solution "loqate_dynamics" imported successfully\'

![](/media/pnghwxzm/d365-install-4s.png){height="486" width="1000"}

At this point you can move on to the next step, and start configuring
your forms.
:::

::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
## []{#Config}Configuring your forms {#configuring-your-forms .p1}

With the solution imported into your environment, the next step is to
configure your forms to use Loqate controls. There is a control for each
of the services available in the solution (you can click the links below
to go to the relevant section of this document):

- [Email Verification](#Email){anchor="#Email"}
- [Phone Verification](#Phone){anchor="#Phone"}
- [Address Search](#Address){anchor="#Address"}

The configuration method is similar for each control, although the
specific configuration options are different depending on which control
you\'re using.

For this example we're going to add the controls to the standard
Customer Contact form, which looks like this:

![](/media/xfqhdu14/dynamics-contact-list.jpeg)

Your forms may well be different and contain different fields or
configurations, but you can apply the same principles.

We're going to add Loqate controls to the Email, the Mobile Phone and
Address 1 fields. All control configurations happen on the form editor.
:::

::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
### []{#Email}Email {#email .p1}

Here are the steps to take to add Loqate controls to the Email field.

- From your Dynamics 365 environment select Settings \> **Advanced
  Settings**. This will open your Business Settings in a new tab
- From the Customisation section of the menu, select Customizations \>
  **Customise the system**
- Select the form you want to update (for this example we\'re editing
  "AI for sales") to open the form editor

![](/media/sdxbxyha/dynamics-form-list.jpeg)

The form editor is where you will be configuring the Loqate controls for
your fields. If you're following the guides for Phone and Email and the
steps say "Go to the form editor for your form", this is where you want
to be.

- Select the Email field in your form to open its Properties menu on the
  right-hand side of the screen
- Expand the Components section, and select the **+ Component** button

![](/media/42ghnkhy/dynamics-add-component.jpg)

- If you've installed or used Loqate before, the Email control may
  already be in the quick selection menu. If this is the first time
  you're installing Loqate, however, you'll likely need to look the
  component up
- To do this, select **Get more components**

![](/media/gwljklqq/dynamics-components-list.jpeg)

- Use the search bar to search for "Loqate". The control is called
  **Loqate - Email Verification**
- Once you have selected the control you will be prompted for some
  configuration information

![](/media/k2hjjjcn/dynamics-email-configuring.jpeg)

- The options available for Email Verification are:
  - **API Key**: your API key for accessing Loqate services (this is a
    **required field**)
  - **Prevent saving invalid emails**: with this set to True, when an
    email is verified and found to be invalid a user will not be able to
    save the form until they have entered and validated a correct email
    address
- With those settings entered, select Done to set the component
- You should now see the component update in the preview

![](/media/hxen3apt/dynamics-email-field-updated.jpeg)

- [S]{.Apple-tab-span}elect **Save and Publish** to update your form and
  publish the control. Depending on your form setup, this can take a
  little time.

Once the form is published, the Email field will be using the Loqate
control. By clicking the button you will now be able to validate an
entered email address.
:::

::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
### []{#Phone}Phone {#phone .p1}

Installing the phone control is a similar process to the Email control,
just with a couple of extra options.

- Go to the Form editor for your form
- Select the **Phone** field to open its Properties menu
- Expand the Components section, and select the **+ Component** button
- Find the **Loqate - Phone Verification** control and select it
- Here are the options for this control:
  - **API Key:** your API key for accessing Loqate services (this is
    a **required** field)
  - **Prevent saving invalid numbers:** with this set to True, when a
    number is verified and found to be invalid a user will not be able
    to save the form until they have entered and validated a correct
    number
  - **Pass if Maybe:** it\'s possible for the Phone Validation service
    to respond with a status of "Maybe". This option will allow you to
    select how you want the control to behave in this scenario: setting
    this to True will mean the control returns a positive result for a
    maybe, while **False** will result in a negative response
- When you have set your options, select **Done**
- You should see the control update in the preview window

![](/media/5sudqart/dynamics-phone-control-updated.jpeg)

- Select **Save and Publish** to update your form and publish the
  control. Depending on your form setup, this can take a little time

Once the form is published, the Phone field will be using the Loqate
control. By selecting a country and clicking the button you will be able
to validate an entered phone number.
:::

::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
### []{#Address}Address {#address .p1}

Installing the address control is a similar process to the Email and
Phone controls, but might require an extra step or two.

NOTE: in the Form editor for your form, y[ou might notice that the
address fields are included as a set, and you\'re not able to select
them
individually:]{style="background-color: var(--cl-white); color: var(--cl-midnight-700);"}

![](/media/uotpigyi/dynamics-address-fields.jpeg)

This is because the Compound field is often used to add addresses to
forms. There are a couple of options for how you manage this:

- - You could remove this part of the form and add the other parts
    individually
  - Or you could add another separate field to handle the address lookup

For this example we'll do the second option. Here are the steps to take
to do this:

- Drag the **Address 1: Street 1 **field from the column list on the
  left, and drop it above the existing address fields
- Select the new field to open its Properties menu, and set its Label to
  \"Address Finder\" (or another description of your choice)
- Expand the Components section, and select the **+ Component** button
- Find and select the **Loqate - Address Search** control
- Here are the available options for this control:
  - **API Key:** your API key for accessing Loqate services (this is
    a **required** field)
  - **Input fields:** the set of options from \'Origin\' down to
    \'Field20Format\' all relate to Loqate input fields, and how you
    want to use them. You can find more information on what these
    options do in the **Request parameters** section of our [Capture
    Find API
    page](https://www.loqate.com/developers/api/Capture/Interactive/Find/1.1/){rel="noopener"
    target="_blank"}
  - **Address:** the set of options from \'Address Line 1\' onwards
    allow you to set where each different address item is inputted into
    your form when an address is returned. For each option in this
    section that you want to return, make sure you select the relevant
    field from your form that you want the address item to map to (note
    that if you don\'t want to return a particular field, you don\'t
    need to map to it)

![](/media/to4h0k2s/dynamics-field-mappings.jpg)

- When you have set your options, select **Done**
- Select **Save and Publish** to update your form and publish the
  control. Depending on your form setup, this can take a little time.

Once the form is published you will be able to perform address lookups
using the new control.

Here\'s an example of how that might look:
