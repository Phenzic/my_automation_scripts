# API Security

We strongly recommend you make your Loqate integration as secure as
possible, in order to keep your account safe and prevent any kind of
malicious use. In this article we\'re going to talk about the various
security options available to you, and some security best practices.

#### Security options

Loqate provides you with various security options, some of which can be
applied across your whole account (and will therefore apply regardless
of which services you\'re using) and others that can be applied to
individual API keys (and therefore individual services). We recommend
you apply as many of these as possible.

#### Securing your account

There are several features available to you in the [Security section of
your
account](https://account.loqate.com/account#/Security){anchor="#/Security"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, that apply across the whole of your
account.

Some of these features are more or less suitable depending on the type
of integration you use, whether it\'s client-side or server-side. For
each one we\'ve included a note regarding which integration type it\'s
most suited to.

**Restrict IP addresses**

Use this feature to block one or more specific IP addresses, and ensure
that they can\'t access any of your Loqate services.
:::

::: {.gd__i .imageblock .screenshot .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
![](/media/uyrd4jlz/image2023-2-28_17-22-43.png?rnd=133360456355170000){height="289"
loading="lazy" width="1061"}
:::

::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
If someone then tries to access one of your services via a restricted IP
address, you\'ll receive an email notification which contains details of
the error that was generated, as well as information about which service
was affected, what the source IP was, etc. Here\'s an example:
:::

::: {.gd__i .imageblock .screenshot .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
![](/media/avudfi4d/account-error-1-updated.png?rnd=133360456361330000){height="419"

:::::
::::::

::: {.gd__i .rte .mtop--32 .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
#### Account password

Make sure you use a strong password to prevent unauthorised access to
your Loqate account.
:::

::: {.gd__i .imageblock .screenshot .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
![](/media/vr0byrvi/image2023-2-28_17-23-20.png?rnd=133360456367770000){height="775"
loading="lazy" width="1058"}
:::

::: {.gd__i .rte .mtop--32 .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
#### Securing your API keys

All Loqate services authenticate your requests using the API key
relevant to that request or service. In order to ensure your keys\'
security, we recommend that you:

- Restrict your keys to specific services (strongly recommended)
- Limit your keys by URLs or IP addresses
- Don\'t embed your keys anywhere that they could be extracted from

You can restrict and/or limit any key in the [Your Services page of the
Account
section](https://account.loqate.com/account#/Dashboard/){anchor="#/Dashboard/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}.

Select the key you want to edit, then click on the **Limits** tab where
you\'ll see these options:
:::

::: {.gd__i .imageblock .screenshot .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
![](/media/lpkd1c4k/image2023-3-1_16-33-23.png?rnd=133360456373800000){height="456"
loading="lazy" width="765"}
:::

::: {.gd__i .rte .mtop--32 .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
#### Limit by URL

To help prevent fraudulent or accidental use of one of your keys across
domains, add the URLs that you expect the requests to be coming from.
Enter a URL address you wish to limit in the text box and then click the
plus icon. You can add as many URLs as you like.

You will also need to specify any subdomains and combinations of URLs
that might be used. i.e. http://www.mysite.co.uk, http://www.mysite.com,
https://mysite.co.uk, etc.

**Limit by IP**

Similar to the Daily Limit, this allows you to place request limits
against a group of IP addresses, which should help manage your cashflow
and cap individual usage. Enter an IP address you wish to limit in the
text box and then click the plus icon. You can add as many IP addresses
as you like.

::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
**[]{#LimitByService}Limit by Service**

We strongly recommend you make use of this option, which allows you to
restrict each API key to one or more Loqate services, rather than
allowing each key to be used for any service.

The default value for this option is blank, in which case that key can
be used for any Loqate service. You can select more than one service to
limit an API key to, for example if you use the same key for Address,
Email and Phone Validation.
:::

:::

::: {.gd__i .rte .break-word .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
Each of those values represents a set of Loqate services. Here\'s how
they\'re broken down:

- Address Capture
  - Capture Find: <https://api.addressy.com/Capture/Interactive/Find/>
  - Capture Retrieve:
    <https://api.addressy.com/Capture/Interactive/Retrieve/>

  - A variety of legacy products including PostcodeAnywhereNorthAmerica,
    PostcodeAnywhereInternational and PostcodeAnywhere/Interactive

This list includes all currently-supported Loqate products. If you
can\'t see a product you\'re using on this list, it\'s likely a legacy
product and will be included either under Capture or Verify (if it\'s an
older version of them) or the specific Legacy option. Please check with
the Loqate Support team if you\'d like to clarify which option to
choose.

**NOTE:** if you created an Address Verification service via your
Account section (i.e. following [the instructions
here](https://www.loqate.com/resources/support/setup-guides/quick/){rel="noopener"
target="_blank"}), choose the Address Capture option rather than Address
Verification (as this refers to the Verify product instead).

#### []{#IntegrationOptions}Integration options

There are two ways of integrating with Loqate\'s APIs - client-side and
server-side - and it\'s worth considering the security implications of
both when you\'re deciding how to integrate. 

Both options provide access to the same services, and only require an
API key. 

- In a **client-side** integration all of the processing for an API in
  completed via a browser, on the end-user\'s device
- In a **server-side** integration all of the processing for an API is
  completed on a web server

We recommend you use a **server-side** integration to ensure the highest
level of security, but in the following sections we\'ll explore the
security implications of both options.

#### Client-side integrations

Client-side integrations are quick and easy to set up, and don\'t
requite a large amount of technical expertise, so they give you the
ability to get up and running without too much time or effort. The
downside to this approach, however, is that it doesn\'t allow you to
implement any of your own monitoring, which means you have less control
over and visibility on the journey your customers go on.

From a security perspective they are also more vulnerable than
server-side integrations, as they don\'t hide your API keys, which means
your keys are visible to anyone viewing the source code of your website.
We\'ve put the previously-discussed security measures in place to help,
including allow-listing features that let you specify which domains and
IP addresses can use your API keys, but if you\'re a high-profile
business, we recommend you use a server-side integration.

If you do decide to use a client-side integration, make sure you use the
available measures to be as secure as you can. For instance, use the
key-specific limits/restrictions mentioned earlier to lock your API keys
down as much as possible.

#### Server-side integrations

Server-side integrations require more technical expertise and resources
to set up, but offer you a greater degree of control over the user
experience. Using this approach you have complete control over your
monitoring, in terms of what your users are requesting and what they see
in response.

This approach is also typically more secure, as it won\'t make any of
your API keys visible, and as such we would always recommend this as the
best option. 

No API integration is invulnerable however, so we still recommend you
use as many of the provided security options as possible even with a
server-side integration.

Whichever approach you take to integrating with Loqate, make sure you
consider the security implications and take steps to ensuring the
security of your site.
