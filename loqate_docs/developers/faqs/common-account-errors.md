Why do I get the error \"License key is no longer valid, it may have
expired\"?

::: content
This error is generated whenever you try and do a lookup using a key
that has been deleted, or has expired. Licence keys can be deleted
through your account online; if you do this by mistake you'll need to
contact us to get them reinstated. With annual user licences available
for the Royal Mail\'s Postcode Address File (PAF®) data, this error will
be displayed if you have not renewed and the licence has expired, again
please contact us.
:::

What does the error \"The licence key has reached its daily limit,
please check your settings or wait until tomorrow\" mean?

::: content
Each per-click licence key has a setting that dictates the total credit
it can consume from the account on a single calendar day. This is a
security setting to help protect your credit from being consumed too
quickly. It can be changed within the edit wizard of the licence key in
question. If you are using a user licence key then the daily limit will
be set at the time of purchase, in accordance with our fair usage
policy.
:::

What does the error \"This license key cannot be used from this website,
the security settings for the license key may not include this domain\"
mean?

::: content
Within your key settings you have the option to limit our service to
only accept requests on that key that are coming from specified website
addresses. This is a security feature to prevent your key from being
used anywhere other than the site you intended. If you set this up and
get this error message please check the URL is formatted correctly and
is available. The website address will be detailed in the table in the
email.
:::

Why do I have the error \"Your credit has run out\"?

::: content
This means your account has run out of credit. An error message email
will be generated when a user tries to do a lookup. The error will
usually show the IP, or URL where the request originated and details of
the service that was used. To fix this, [log into your
account](https://account.loqate.com/Login/){rel="noopener"
target="_blank"} and top up with credit.
:::

What does the error message \"Free Service Limit Exceeded\" mean?

::: content
[The Free Service Limit Exceeded error occurs automatically when there
are a significantly higher number of uncharged requests in comparison to
charged. For ]{contrast="auto"}[example]{contrast="auto"}[, when using
the address validation service, a find (free) request should usually be
followed by a retrieve (charged) request. This error is highlighting an
imbalance in free and charged calls to the service. Check the usage on

installed correctly. ]{contrast="auto"}[If the calls to the service are

What is the account error \"Surge protector triggered\"?

::: content
[[The surge protector detects when there is a notable or out of average
