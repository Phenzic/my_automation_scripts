::::::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
### []{#initialisation}Initialisation

When you instantiate a new **Capture** object you will get a reference
to an object commonly referred to as the **control** object.

::: {.docs-example-box .snippet .bg-midnight-600 .mtop--32 .mbtm--32}
``` {.line-numbers .bg-midnight-600 .language-javascript}
let control = new Capture(fields, options);
```
:::

The constructor takes two arguments, **fields** and **options**.

The **fields** argument lets the control know what fields it should use
for a search term, and what data to put where when an address is
selected by the user.

The **options** argument allows you to set a variety of options to
specify how the control will behave. The only required option is
\'key\', which should be a string representation of your api key.

::: {.docs-example-box .snippet .bg-midnight-600 .mtop--32 .mbtm--32}
``` {.line-numbers .bg-midnight-600 .language-javascript}
"bafe2b83-d37b-4d5d-92ad-f3f4c57a3621"
```
:::

The resulting control object provides all methods and properties to
customise the address capture experience.

**Note:** You will typically have one of the these objects for each of
your address forms, so it is important to give them individual
references or store them in a list.

::: {.docs-example-box .snippet .bg-midnight-600 .mtop--32 .mbtm--32}
``` {.line-numbers .bg-midnight-600 .language-javascript}
let billingControl = new Capture(billingFields, billingOptions);
let shippingControl = new Capture(shippingFields,shippingOptions);
```
:::

Before calling methods on the control you should listen for the **load**
event to ensure the control is ready.

::: {.docs-example-box .snippet .bg-midnight-600 .mtop--32 .mbtm--32}
``` {.line-numbers .bg-midnight-600 .language-javascript}
let control = new Capture(fields, options);
 
control.listen("load", function() {
    control.setCountry("CAN");
});
```
:::
:::::::

::::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
### []{#mapping}Mapping your fields

The address capture control needs to know which elements of the address
should be put into each of your fields. It also needs to know which
fields should be used for searching and which field (if any) contains
the country. This information is provided in a standard format, which is
an array of objects that have an **element**, **field** and optional
**mode** property.

::: {.docs-example-box .snippet .bg-midnight-600 .mtop--32 .mbtm--32}
``` {.line-numbers .bg-midnight-600 .language-javascript}
let fields = [
    { element: "#search", field: "" },
    { element: "#company", field: "company", mode: FieldMode.DEFAULT | FieldMode.PRESERVE },
    { element: "#line1", field: "line1" },
    { element: "#line2", field: "line2", mode: FieldMode.POPULATE },
    { element: "#city", field: "city", mode: FieldMode.POPULATE },
    { element: "#state", field: "province", mode: FieldMode.POPULATE },
    { element: "#postcode", field: "postalCode" },
    { element: "#country", field: "countryName", mode: FieldMode.COUNTRY }
];
```
:::

#### The code explained

- **element** is a query selector string for your field, or the input
  element itself.
- **field** is the name of the address element that should be put into
  this field. For a list of the available fields see the Capture
  Interactive Retrieve. The field can also take the form of a format
  string, which is detailed in the next section.
- **mode** will tell the control how this field should be used. There
  are four options which can be set or combined together. The default
  setting is **SEARCH** and **POPULATE**. Field modes are declared in
  the **FieldMode** enum. It is a bitset field and modes can be combined
  using the JavaScript bitwise OR operator (\|)
  - **SEARCH** will enable autocomplete searching from the field. When
    the user clicks into this field the control will be shown and, as
    they type, suggestions will appear.
  - **POPULATE** will cause the control to set the field value based on
    the address that the user selected. This mode is almost always used
    but, in the event that you wish to handle the population of fields
    yourself, you can ignore it.
  - **COUNTRY** will cause the control to display the country list when
    the user selects the field. The control will also attempt to read
    the value of this field when it loads and set the country to search
    in.
  - **PRESERVE** is used to prevent the control from overwriting fields
    which might have already been populated by the user, prior to
    searching for their address. A good use case for this is company
    name. If the field already has a value the control will not
    overwrite it, but if the field is currently blank it will be
    populated.

::::::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
### []{#advanced}Advanced field formats

To define complex or custom field values, the control makes use of
template strings. The template strings work by replacing field values
from the selected address, based on field names which are enclosed in
curly brackets, for example \"**{postalCode}**\".

::: {.docs-example-box .snippet .bg-midnight-600 .mtop--32 .mbtm--32}
``` {.line-numbers .bg-midnight-600 .language-javascript}
let fields = [
  { element: "#postcode", field: "{postalCode}" }
];
```
:::

Any regular text or HTML can be included in the template strings around
the field values, such as \"**\<b\>{line1}\</b\>, {line2}**\".

::: {.docs-example-box .snippet .bg-midnight-600 .mtop--32 .mbtm--32}
``` {.line-numbers .bg-midnight-600 .language-javascript}
let fields = [
  { element: "#lin1and2", field: "{line1}, {line2}" }
];
```
:::

Conditional formatting can be added by enclosing the field, and any
additional text which is conditional on the field having a value, in a
second set of curly brackets. If the template string was \"**{line1}{,
{line2}}**\" then the comma would not appear unless the selected address
had a second address line.

::: {.docs-example-box .snippet .bg-midnight-600 .mtop--32 .mbtm--32}
``` {.line-numbers .bg-midnight-600 .language-javascript}
let fields = [
  { element: "#line1And2IfItExists", field: "{line1}{, {line2}}" }
];
```
:::

Finally, field values will always appear in title case, but can easily
be capitalised by adding an exclamation mark (!) at the end of the field
name, like this \"**{city!}**\".

::: {.docs-example-box .snippet .bg-midnight-600 .mtop--32 .mbtm--32}
``` {.line-numbers .bg-midnight-600 .language-javascript}
let fields = [
  { element: "#capitalisedCity", field: "{city!}" }
];
```
:::
:::::::

::::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
### []{#setting}Setting options

The second parameter that is required by the address control is a
configuration object. This is used to set options and customise how the
control behaves. The only required option is the API key that you will
be using to access the web services.

::: {.docs-example-box .snippet .bg-midnight-600 .mtop--32 .mbtm--32}
``` {.line-numbers .bg-midnight-600 .language-javascript}
let options = {
    key: "bafe2b83-d37b-4d5d-92ad-f3f4c57a3621"
}
```
:::

Further options can be set by adding more information to the
configuration object. To create a control that limits addresses to the
United States and Canada, but set the country based upon the users IP
address, you would define the following object:

::: {.docs-example-box .snippet .bg-midnight-600 .mtop--32 .mbtm--32}
``` {.line-numbers .bg-midnight-600 .language-javascript}
let options = {
    key: "bafe2b83-d37b-4d5d-92ad-f3f4c57a3621",
    countries: {
        codesList: "USA,CAN"
    }
}
```
:::
:::::

:::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
### []{#limiting}Limiting the search to specific countries

Capture+ is designed to be a truly international address verification
and standardisation solution, and will by default allow you to search
through all of the countries that we cover.

However, you can limit the countries that Capture+ will search by adding
search settings into your options object.

For example, to create a control that was limited to the United States
and Canada, but set the country based upon the users IP address, you
would define the following object:

::: {.docs-example-box .snippet .bg-midnight-600 .mtop--32 .mbtm--32}
``` {.line-numbers .bg-midnight-600 .language-javascript}
let options = {
    key: "bafe2b83-d37b-4d5d-92ad-f3f4c57a3621",
    countries: {
        codesList: "USA,CAN"
    }
}
```
:::
::::

:::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
### []{#translation}Translation

Both the control and web service API support a variety of language
cultures. The language is automatically detected from the user\'s web
browser but we also provide a **culture** option and **setCulture**
method. The culture is based on 2-character code (e.g. "en", "fr") or
culture name (e.g. "en_GB", "en_US", "fr_FR", "fr_CA").

::: {.docs-example-box .snippet .bg-midnight-600 .mtop--32 .mbtm--32}
``` {.line-numbers .bg-midnight-600 .language-javascript}
let options = {
  key: "bafe2b83-d37b-4d5d-92ad-f3f4c57a3621",
  culture: "fr"
}
```
:::
::::

::::: {.gd__i .rte .c12 style="--cspan:12;--rspan:1;--cstart:auto;"}
### []{#events}Events and listeners

The address capture library implements a simple events model which will
allow you to listen out for when certain things happen. To listen for an
event use the **listen** method with the event name and a function to
run when that event occurs. Events can sometimes pass additional details
through parameters.

::: {.docs-example-box .snippet .bg-midnight-600 .mtop--32 .mbtm--32}
``` {.line-numbers .bg-midnight-600 .language-javascript}
control.listen("populate", function(address, variations) {
    document.getElementById("myCustomField").value = address.PostalCode;
});
```
:::

View all available events

::: content
The following events can be listened for on the control object.

  Event         What it means
  ------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  show          The control is now visible on the page.
  hide          The control has been hidden.
  search        The user is searching. You can modify the searchTerm and lastId of the search object (parameter 1) at this stage.
  results       Results have been returned from the find service. You can modify the list of suggestions returned (parameter 1) and access the extended attributes object (parameter 2) including properties such as ContainerCount.
  noresults     No matching results were returned from the find service.
  display       The suggestions have been shown to the user.
  select        The user has selected a suggestion. The chosen suggestion can be accessed (parameter 1).
  prepopulate   The full address has been returned from the retrieve service. The address object (parameter 1) can be accessed and modified before fields are populated, as well as full list of language variations (parameter 2) for the address.
  populate      The address fields have been populated. This is the most common event to listen for, and will allow you to populate your own fields with your own logic using the address object (parameter 1) and the list of address variations (parameter 2).
  country       The country has been changed. The selected country object (parameter 1) with iso2, iso3 and name properties is passed through.
  manual        When the manualEntry option is passed through and the user selects the option to enter their address manually this event will fire.
  error         An error has occured. The error message (parameter 1) is passed through. Typically errors are not shown to the user, but can be handled manually here if needed.

### []{#retrieving}Retrieving co-ordinate data

To get coordinates you will need to map **{latitude}** and
**{longitude}** to fields:

### []{#common}Common customisations

#### Adding a manual entry item:

You can add an item which will appear at the bottom of the list at the
end of a search, and will allow the user to enter their address without
autocomplete. When the user selects the item, the **manual** event will
be fired and control will be disabled while they enter their address.
This can be done by setting the **manualEntryItem** option to **true**
or calling the **addManualEntryItem** method.

#### Hiding and showing the control:

To manually hide the control it is best to call the **control.destroy**
method. This will remove the control from the page and stop it listening
to any events. You can reload the control at any time by calling the
**control.load** method.

### []{#optimising}Optimising your address form

There are a few things that can make a form easier to work with:

- Create input fields which are appropriate for the data type, we would
  recommend that you have:
  - Between 2 and 5 text input boxes for the address lines. Address
    structures around the world will vary, so make your main address
    input flexible enough for anyone to enter their details.
  - Separate text input fields for the city and postal code.
  - Either text inputs or select lists for the state/province and
    country. Address Verification can work well with select lists, but
    make sure you use a recognised name for the text value, and codes
    for the option id. We make use of the ISO 3166 standard country
    names and regions.
- Make sure each of your fields has a unique id. An id which is related
  to the information you are expecting to capture will be helpful, for
  example: "line1", "line2", "city", "state", "postcode", "country". You
  can prefix or suffix each id to distinguish between different address
  forms, e.g. "billing_line1", "shipping_line1"
- Let the user know what kind of information you want from them. Make
  use of HTML label elements and input placeholder attributes.
- Do not force too much validation upon the user. Address Verification
  will help them avoid mistakes as they enter their address, but you can
  still allow them to modify it and add extra detail where necessary.

### []{#troubleshooting}Troubleshooting

If the address capture control is not working, there a few things to
check:

#### The control is loading before the fields have been rendered

The control will wait until the DOM has finished loading before it
initialises, but still this can sometimes be before your address fields
have been added to the page. Check out the dynamic pages section of this
guide for solutions to this issue.

#### There is an error somewhere on the page

Most modern web browsers will come with built in developer tools. On
most systems this is accessed by pressing **F12**. Check the console
section of your developer tools for any error information which should
help with diagnosing the issue.

#### Account or key settings

Make sure that you are using the correct key in your code. If there any
issues with your account or key settings you should receive an email
from us automatically.

### []{#dynamic}Dynamic pages

The control will bind to your mapped fields as soon as it is
initialised. This becomes more tricky when working with dynamic pages
and asynchronous postbacks. If you need to rebind your control you can
call **reload** on the control object. The control will them re-bind to
the currently available fields.
